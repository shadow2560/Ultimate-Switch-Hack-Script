</P>
<A NAME="PortableAndTemporaryCopyRestrictions"></A>
<H3>3.3. Portable and Temporary Copy Restrictions</H3>
<P>
If you want to take NVDA with you on a USB thumb drive or other writable media, then you should choose to create a portable copy.
The installed copy is also able to create a portable copy of itself at any time. 
The portable copy also has the ability to install itself on any computer at a later time.
However, if you wish to copy NVDA onto read-only media such as a CD, you should just copy the download package.
Running the portable version directly from read-only media is not supported at this time.
Using the temporary copy of NVDA is also an option (e.g. for demonstration purposes), though starting NVDA in this way each time can become very time consuming.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the inability to automatically start during and/or after log-on, the portable and temporary copies of NVDA also have the following restrictions:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The inability to interact with applications running with administrative privileges, unless of course NVDA itself has been run also with these privileges (not recommended).
<LI>The inability to read User Account Control (UAC) screens when trying to start an application with administrative privileges.
<LI>Windows 8 and later: the inability to support input from a touchscreen.
<LI>Windows 8 and later: the inability to provide features such as browse mode and speaking of typed characters in Windows Store apps.
<LI>Windows 8 and later: audio ducking is not supported.

<H2>4. Using NVDA</H2>
<A NAME="LaunchingNVDA"></A>
<H3>4.1. Launching NVDA</H3>
<P>
If you have installed NVDA with the installer, then starting NVDA is as simple as either pressing control+alt+n, or choosing NVDA from the NVDA menu under Programs on the Start Menu.
Additionally you can type NVDA into the Run dialog and press Enter.
If NVDA is already running, it will be restarted.
You can also pass some <A HREF="#CommandLineOptions">command line options</A> which allows you to quit (-q), disable add-ons (--disable-addons), etc.
</P>
<P>
For installed copies, NVDA stores the configuration in the roaming application data folder of the current user by default (e.g. "C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Roaming").
It is possible to change this in a way that NVDA loads its configuration from the local application data folder instead.
Consult the section about <A HREF="#SystemWideParameters">system wide parameters</A> for more details.
</P>
<P>
To start the portable version, go to the directory you unpacked NVDA to, and press enter or double click on nvda.exe.
If NVDA was already running, it will automatically stop before starting the portable version.
</P>
<P>
As NVDA starts, you will first hear an ascending set of tones (telling you that NVDA is loading).
Depending on how fast your computer is, or if you are running NVDA off a USB key or other slow media, it may take a little while to start.
If it is taking an extra-long time to start, NVDA should say "Loading NVDA. Please wait..."
</P>
<P>
If you don't hear any of this, or you hear the Windows error sound, or a descending set of tones, then this means that NVDA has an error, and you will need to possibly report a bug to the developers.
Please check out the NVDA website for how to do this.
</P>
<A NAME="WelcomeDialog"></A>
<H4>4.1.1. Welcome Dialog</H4>

The dialog box also contains a combo box and three checkboxes.
The combo box lets you select the keyboard layout.
The first checkbox lets you control if NVDA should use the Caps Lock as an NVDA modifier key.
The second specifies whether NVDA should start automatically after you log on to Windows and is only available for installed copies of NVDA.
The third lets you control if this Welcome dialog should appear each time NVDA starts.
</P>
<A NAME="UsageStatsDialog"></A>
<H4>4.1.2. Data usage statistics dialog</H4>
<P>
Starting from NVDA 2018.3, the user is asked if they want to allow usage data to be sent to NV Access in order to help improve NVDA in the future. 
When starting NVDA for the first time, a dialog will appear which will ask you if you want to accept sending data to NV Access while using NVDA.
You can read more info about the data gathered by NV Access in the general settings section, <A HREF="#GeneralSettingsGatherUsageStats">Allow the NVDA project to gather NVDA usage statistics</A>.
Note: pressing on "yes" or "no" will save this setting and the dialog will never appear again unless you reinstall NVDA.
However, you can enable or disable the data gathering process manually in NVDA's general settings panel. For changing this setting manually, you can check or uncheck the checkbox called <A HREF="#GeneralSettingsGatherUsageStats">Allow the NVDA project to gather NVDA usage statistics</A>.

<H3>4.2. About NVDA keyboard commands</H3>
<A NAME="TheNVDAModifierKey"></A>
<H4>4.2.1. The NVDA Modifier Key</H4>
<P>
Most NVDA-specific keyboard commands consist of pressing a particular key called the NVDA modifier key in conjunction with one or more other keys.
Notable exceptions to this are the text review commands for the desktop keyboard layout which just use the numpad keys by themselves, but there are some other exceptions as well.
</P>
<P>
NVDA can be configured so that the numpad Insert, Extended Insert and/or Caps Lock key can be used as the NVDA modifier key.
By default, both the numpad Insert and Extended Insert keys are set as NVDA modifier keys.
</P>
<P>
If you wish to cause one of the NVDA modifier keys to behave as it usually would if NVDA were not running (e.g. you wish to turn Caps Lock on when you have set Caps Lock to be an NVDA modifier key), you can press the key twice in quick succession.
</P>
<A NAME="KeyboardLayouts"></A>
<H4>4.2.2. Keyboard Layouts</H4>
<P>
NVDA currently comes with two sets of key commands (known as keyboard layouts): the desktop layout and the laptop layout.
By default, NVDA  is set to use the Desktop layout, though you can switch to the Laptop layout in the Keyboard category of the <A HREF="#NVDASettings">NVDA Settings</A> dialog, found under Preferences in the NVDA menu.
</P>
<P>
The Desktop layout makes heavy use of the numpad (with Num Lock off).
Although most laptops do not have a physical numpad, some laptops can emulate one by holding down the FN key and pressing letters and numbers on the right-hand side of the keyboard (7, 8, 9, u, i, o, j, k, l, etc.).
If your laptop cannot do this or does not allow you to turn Num Lock off, you may want to switch to the Laptop layout instead.
</P>
<A NAME="NVDATouchGestures"></A>
<H3>4.3. NVDA Touch Gestures</H3>
<P>
If you are running NVDA on a device with a touchscreen and running Windows 8 or higher, you can also control NVDA directly via touch commands.
While NVDA is running, unless touch interaction support is disabled, all touch input will go directly to NVDA. 
Therefore, actions that can be performed normally without NVDA will not work.
To toggle touch interaction support, press NVDA+control+alt+t.
You can also enable or disable <A HREF="#TouchSupportEnable">touch interaction support</A> from the Touch Interaction category of the NVDA settings.
</P>
<A NAME="ExploringTheScreen"></A>
<H4>4.3.1. Exploring the Screen</H4>
<P>
The most basic action you can perform with the touch screen is to announce the control or text at any point on the screen.
To do this, place one finger anywhere on the screen.
You can also keep your finger on the screen and move it around to read other controls and text that your finger moves over.
</P>
<A NAME="TouchGestures"></A>
<H4>4.3.2. Touch Gestures</H4>
<P>
When NVDA commands are described later in this user guide, they may list a touch gesture which can be used to activate that command with the touchscreen.
Following are some instructions on how to perform the various touch gestures.
</P>
<H5>Taps</H5>
<P>
Tap the screen quickly with one or more fingers.
</P>
<P>
Tapping once with one  finger is simply known as a tap.
Tapping with 2 fingers at the same time is a 2-finger tap and so on.
</P>
<P>
If the same tap is performed one or more times again in quick succession, NVDA will instead treat this as a multi-tap gesture.
Tapping twice will result in a double-tap.
Tapping 3 times will result in a triple-tap and so on.
Of course, these multi-tap gestures also recognize how many fingers were used, so it's possible to have gestures like a 2-finger triple-tap, a 4-finger tap, etc. 
</P>
<H5>Flicks</H5>
<P>
Quickly swipe your finger across the screen.
</P>
<P>
There are 4 possible flick gestures depending on the direction: flick left, flick right, flick up and flick down.
</P>
<P>
Just like taps, more than one finger can be used to perform the gesture.
Therefore, gestures such as 2-finger flick up and 4-finger flick left are all possible.
</P>
<A NAME="TouchModes"></A>
<H4>4.3.3. Touch Modes</H4>
<P>
As there are many more NVDA commands than possible touch gestures, NVDA has several touch modes you can switch between which make certain subsets of commands available.
The two modes are text mode and object mode. 
Certain NVDA commands listed in this document may have a touch mode listed in brackets after the touch gesture.
For example, flick up (text mode) means that the command will be performed if you flick up, but only while in text mode.
If the command does not have a mode listed, it will work in any mode.
</P>
<P>
To toggle touch modes, perform a 3-finger tap.
</P>
<A NAME="TouchKeyboard"></A>
<H4>4.3.4. Touch keyboard</H4>
<P>
The touch keyboard is used to enter text and commands from a touchscreen.
When focused on an edit field, you can bring up the touch keyboard by double-tapping the touch keyboard icon on the bottom of the screen.
For tablets such as Microsoft Surface Pro, the touch keyboard is always available when the keyboard is undocked.
To dismiss the touch keyboard, double-tap the touch keyboard icon or move away from the edit field.
</P>
<P>
While the touch keyboard is active, to locate keys on the touch keyboard, move your finger to where the touch keyboard is located (typically at the bottom of the screen), then move around the keyboard with one finger.
When you find the key you wish to press, double-tap the key or lift your finger, depending on options chosen from the <A HREF="#TouchInteraction">Touch Interaction Settings category</A> of the NVDA Settings.
</P>
<A NAME="InputHelpMode"></A>
<H3>4.4. Input Help Mode</H3>
<P>
Many NVDA commands are mentioned throughout the rest of this user guide, but an easy way to explore all the different commands is to turn on input help.
</P>
<P>
To turn on input help, press NVDA+1.
To turn it off, press NVDA+1 again.
While in input help, performing any input gesture (such as pressing a key or performing a touch gesture) will report the action and describe what it does (if anything).
The actual  commands will not execute while in input help mode.
</P>
<A NAME="TheNVDAMenu"></A>
<H3>4.5. The NVDA menu</H3>
<P>
The NVDA menu allows you to control NVDA's settings, access help, save/revert your configuration, Modify speech dictionaries, access additional tools and exit NVDA.
</P>
<P>
To get to the NVDA menu from anywhere in Windows while NVDA is running, press NVDA+n on the keyboard or perform a 2-finger double-tap on the touch screen.
You can also get to the NVDA menu via the Windows system tray.
Either right-click on the NVDA icon located in the system tray, or access the system tray by pressing the Windows logo key+B, DownArrow to the NVDA icon and press the applications key located next to the right control key on most keyboards.
When the menu comes up, You can use the arrow keys to navigate the menu, and the enter key to activate an item.

<A NAME="NavigatingWithNVDA"></A>
<H2>5. Navigating with NVDA</H2>
<P>
NVDA allows you to explore and navigate the system in several ways, including both normal interaction and review.
</P>
<A NAME="Objects"></A>
<H3>5.1. Objects</H3>
<P>
Each Application and the operating system itself consist of many objects.
An object is a single item such as a piece of text, button, checkbox, slider, list or editable text field.
</P>
<A NAME="SystemFocus"></A>
<H3>5.2. Navigating with the System Focus</H3>
<P>
The system focus, also known simply as the focus, is the <A HREF="#Objects">object</A> which receives keys typed on the keyboard.
For example, if you are typing into an editable text field, the editable text field has the focus.
</P>
<P>
The most common way of navigating around Windows with NVDA is to simply move the system focus using standard Windows keyboard commands, such as pressing tab and shift+tab to move forward and back between controls, pressing alt to get to the menu bar and then using the arrows to navigate menus, and using alt+tab to move between running applications.
As you do this, NVDA will report information about the object with focus, such as its name, type, value, state, description, keyboard shortcut and positional information.
When <A HREF="#VisionFocusHighlight">Visual Highlight</A> is enabled, the location of the current system focus is also exposed visually.
</P>
<P>
There are some key commands that are useful when moving with the System focus:

</TABLE>

<A NAME="SystemCaret"></A>
<H3>5.3. Navigating with the System Caret</H3>
<P>
When an <A HREF="#Objects">object</A> that allows navigation and/or editing of text is <A HREF="#SystemFocus">focused</A>, you can move through the text using the system caret, also known as the edit cursor.
</P>
<P>
When the focus is on an object that has the system caret, you can use the arrow keys, page up, page down, home, end, etc. to move through the text.
You can also change the text if the control supports editing.
NVDA will announce as you move by character, word and line, and will also announce as you select and unselect text.
</P>
<P>
NVDA provides the following key commands in relation to the system caret:

<A NAME="ObjectNavigation"></A>
<H3>5.4. Object Navigation</H3>
<P>
Most of the time, you will work with applications using commands which move the <A HREF="#SystemFocus">focus</A> and the <A HREF="#SystemCaret">caret</A>.
However, sometimes, you may wish to explore the current application or the Operating System without moving the focus or caret.
You may also wish to work with <A HREF="#Objects">objects</A> that cannot be accessed normally using the keyboard.
In these cases, you can use object navigation.
</P>
<P>
Object navigation allows you to move between and obtain information about individual <A HREF="#Objects">objects</A>.
When you move to an object, NVDA will report it similarly to the way it reports the system focus.
For a way to review all text as it appears on the screen, you can instead use <A HREF="#ScreenReview">screen review</A>.
</P>
<P>
Rather than having to move back and forth between every single object on the system, the objects are organized hierarchically.
This means that some objects contain other objects and you must move inside them to access the objects they contain.
For example, a list contains list items, so you must move inside the list in order to access its items.
If you have moved to a list item, moving next and previous will take you to other list items in the same list.
Moving to a list item's containing object will take you back to the list.
You can then move past the list if you wish to access other objects.
Similarly, a toolbar contains controls, so you must move inside the toolbar to access the controls in the toolbar.
</P>
<P>
The object currently being reviewed is called the navigator object.
Once you navigate to an object, you can review its content using the <A HREF="#ReviewingText">text review commands</A> while in <A HREF="#ObjectReview">Object review mode</A>.
When <A HREF="#VisionFocusHighlight">Visual Highlight</A> is enabled, the location of the current navigator object is also exposed visually.
By default, the navigator object moves along with the System focus, though this behaviour can be toggled on and off.
</P>
<P>
Note: Braille following Object Navigation can be configured via <A HREF="#BrailleTether">Braille Tether</A>.

<A NAME="ReviewingText"></A>
<H3>5.5. Reviewing Text</H3>
<P>
NVDA allows you to read the contents of the <A HREF="#ScreenReview">screen</A>, current <A HREF="#DocumentReview">document</A> or current <A HREF="#ObjectReview">object</A> by character, word or line.
This is mostly useful in places (including Windows command consoles) where there is no <A HREF="#SystemCaret">system caret</A>.
For example, you might use it to review the text of a long information message in a dialog.
</P>
<P>
When moving the review cursor, the System caret does not follow along, so you can review text without losing your editing position.
However, by default, when the System caret moves, the review cursor follows along.
This can be toggled on and off.

Note: numpad keys require the Num Lock to be turned off to work properly.
</P>
<P>
A good way to remember the basic text review commands  when using the Desktop layout  is to think of them as being in a grid of three by three, with top to bottom being line, word and character and left to right being previous, current and next.
The layout is illustrated as follows:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="4">
<TR>
<TD>Previous line</TD>
<TD>Current line</TD>
<TD>Next line</TD>
</TR>

<TD>Next character</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<A NAME="ReviewModes"></A>
<H3>5.6. Review Modes</H3>
<P>
NVDA's <A HREF="#ReviewingText">text review commands</A> can review content within the current navigator object, current document or screen, depending on the review mode selected.
Review modes are a replacement for the older Flat Review concept found in NVDA.
</P>
<P>
The following commands switch between review modes:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="4">

<TD>NVDA+numpad1</TD>
<TD>NVDA+pageDown</TD>
<TD>2-finger flick down</TD>
<TD>switches to the previous available review mode</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<A NAME="ObjectReview"></A>
<H4>5.6.1. Object Review</H4>
<P>
While in object review mode, you are able to only review the content of the current <A HREF="#ObjectNavigation">navigator object</A>.
For objects such as editable text fields or other basic text controls, this will generally be the text content.
For other objects, this may be the name and/or value.
</P>
<A NAME="DocumentReview"></A>
<H4>5.6.2. Document Review</H4>
<P>
When the <A HREF="#ObjectNavigation">navigator object</A> is within a browse mode document (e.g. web page) or other complex document (e.g. a Lotus Symphony document), it is possible to switch to the document review mode.
The document review mode allows you to review the text of the entire document.
</P>
<P>
When switching from object review to document review, the review cursor is placed in the document at the position of the navigator object.
When moving around the document with review commands, the navigator object is automatically updated to the object found at the current review cursor position.
</P>
<P>
Note that NVDA will switch to document review from object review automatically when moving around browse mode documents.
</P>
<A NAME="ScreenReview"></A>
<H4>5.6.3. Screen Review</H4>
<P>
The screen review mode allows you to review the text of the screen as it appears visually within the current application.
This is similar to the screen review or mouse cursor functionality in many other Windows screen readers.
</P>
<P>
When switching to screen review mode, the review cursor is placed at the screen position of the current <A HREF="#ObjectNavigation">navigator object</A>.
When moving around the screen with review commands, the navigator object is automatically updated to the object found at the screen position of the review cursor.
</P>
<P>
Note that in some newer applications, NVDA may not see some or all text displayed on the screen due to the use of newer screen drawing technologies which are impossible to support at this time.
</P>
<A NAME="NavigatingWithTheMouse"></A>
<H3>5.7. Navigating with the Mouse</H3>
<P>
When you move the mouse, NVDA by default reports the text that is directly under the mouse pointer as the pointer moves over it.
Where supported, NVDA will read the surrounding paragraph of text, though some controls may only read by line.
</P>
<P>
NVDA can be configured to also announce the type of <A HREF="#Objects">object</A> under the mouse as it moves (e.g. list, button, etc.).
This may be useful for totally blind users, as sometimes, the text isn't enough.
</P>
<P>
NVDA provides a way for users to understand where the mouse is located relative to the dimensions of the screen by playing the current mouse coordinates as audio beeps.
The higher the mouse is on the screen, the higher the pitch of the beeps.
The further left or right the mouse is located on the screen, the further left or right the sound will be played (assuming the user has stereo speakers or headphones).
</P>
<P>
These extra mouse features are not turned on by default in NVDA.
If you wish to take advantage of them, you can configure them from the <A HREF="#MouseSettings">Mouse settings</A> category of the <A HREF="#NVDASettings">NVDA Settings</A> dialog, found in the NVDA Preferences menu.
</P>
<P>
Although a physical mouse or trackpad should be used to navigate with the mouse, NVDA provides some commands related to the mouse:
</P>

</TR>
</TABLE>

<A NAME="BrowseMode"></A>
<H2>6. Browse Mode</H2>
<P>
Complex read-only documents such as web pages are browsed in NVDA using browse mode.
This includes documents in the following applications:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Mozilla Firefox
<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer
<LI>Mozilla Thunderbird
<LI>HTML messages in Microsoft Outlook
<LI>Google Chrome
<LI>Microsoft Edge
<LI>Adobe Reader
<LI>Foxit Reader
<LI>Supported books in Amazon Kindle for PC
</UL>

<P></P>
<P>
Browse mode is also optionally available for Microsoft Word documents.
</P>
<P>
In browse mode, the content of the document is made available in a flat representation that can be navigated with the cursor keys as if it were a normal text document.
All of NVDA's <A HREF="#SystemCaret">system caret</A> key commands will work in this mode; e.g. say all, report formatting, table navigation commands, etc.
When <A HREF="#VisionFocusHighlight">Visual Highlight</A> is enabled, the location of the virtual browse mode caret is also exposed visually.
Information such as whether text is a link, heading, etc. is reported along with the text as you move.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, you will need to interact directly with controls in these documents.
For example, you will need to do this for editable text fields and lists so that you can type characters and use the cursor keys to work with the control.
You do this by switching to focus mode, where almost all keys are passed to the control.
When in Browse mode, by default, NVDA will automatically switch to focus mode if you tab to or click on a particular control that requires it.
Conversely, tabbing to or clicking on a control that does not require focus mode will switch back to browse mode.
You can also press enter or space to switch to focus mode on controls that require it.
Pressing escape will switch back to browse mode.
In addition, you can manually force focus mode, after which it will remain in effect until you choose to disable it.

<A NAME="ReadingMath"></A>
<H2>7. Reading Mathematical Content</H2>
<P>
Using MathPlayer 4 from Design Science, NVDA can read and interactively navigate supported mathematical content.
This requires that MathPlayer 4 is installed on the computer.
MathPlayer is available as a free download from: <A HREF="https://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathplayer/">https://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathplayer/</A>.
After installing MathPlayer, restart NVDA.
</P>
<P>
NVDA supports the following types of mathematical content:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>MathML in Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Google Chrome.
<LI>Microsoft Word 365 Modern Math Equations via UI automation:
NVDA is able to read and interact with math equations in Microsoft Word 365/2016 build 14326 and higher.
Note however that any previously created MathType equations must be first converted to Office Math.
This can be done by selecting each and choosing "Equation Options", then "Convert to Office Math" in the context menu.
Ensure your version of MathType is the latest version before doing this.
Microsoft Word provides linear symbol-based navigation through the equations itself and supports inputting math using several syntaxes, including LateX.
For further details, please see <A HREF="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/linear-format-equations-using-unicodemath-and-latex-in-word-2e00618d-b1fd-49d8-8cb4-8d17f25754f8">Linear format equations using UnicodeMath and LaTeX in Word</A>
<LI>Microsoft Powerpoint, and older versions of Microsoft Word: 
NVDA can read and navigate MathType equations in both Microsoft Powerpoint and Microsoft word.
MathType needs to be installed in order for this to work.
The trial version is sufficient.
It can be downloaded from <A HREF="https://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathtype/">https://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathtype/</A>
<LI>Adobe Reader:
Note that this is not an official standard yet, so there is currently no publicly available software that can produce this content.
<LI>Kindle Reader for PC:
NVDA can read and navigate Math in Kindle for PC for books with accessible math.
</UL>

<P></P>
<P>
When reading a document, NVDA will speak any supported mathematical content where it occurs.
If you are using a braille display, it will also be displayed in braille.
</P>
<A NAME="InteractiveNavigation"></A>
<H3>7.1. Interactive Navigation</H3>
<P>

If you are in browse mode, you can do this by moving the cursor to the mathematical content and pressing enter.
</P>
<P>
If you are not in browse mode:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>move the review cursor to the mathematical content.

</TABLE>

<A NAME="BrailleInput"></A>
<H3>8.2. Braille Input</H3>
<P>
NVDA supports entry of both uncontracted and contracted braille via a braille keyboard.
You can select the translation table used to translate braille into text using the <A HREF="#BrailleSettingsInputTable">Input table</A> setting in the Braille category of the <A HREF="#NVDASettings">NVDA Settings</A> dialog.
</P>
<P>
When uncontracted braille is being used, text is inserted as soon as it is entered.
When using contracted braille, text is inserted when you press space or enter at the end of a word.
Note that translation can only reflect the braille word you are typing and cannot consider existing text.
For example, if you are using a braille code that begins numbers with a number sign and you press backspace to move to the end of a number, you will need to type the number sign again to enter additional numbers.
</P>
<P>
Pressing dot 7 erases the last entered braille cell or character.
Dot 8 translates any braille input and presses the enter key.
Pressing dot 7 + dot 8 translates any braille input, but without adding a space or pressing enter.
</P>
<A NAME="BrailleKeyboardShortcuts"></A>
<H4>8.2.1. Inputting keyboard shortcuts</H4>
<P>
NVDA supports inputting keyboard shortcuts and emulating keypresses using the braille display.
This emulation comes in two forms: assigning a Braille input directly to some key press and using the virtual modifier keys.
</P>
<P>
Commonly-used keys, such as the arrow keys or pressing Alt to reach menus, can be mapped directly to Braille inputs.
The driver for each Braille display comes pre-equipped with some of these assignments.
You can change these assignments or add new emulated keys from the <A HREF="#InputGestures">Input Gestures dialog</A>.
</P>
<P>
While this approach is useful for commonly-pressed or unique keys (such as Tab), you may not want to assign a unique set of keys to each keyboard shortcut.
To allow emulating keypresses where modifier keys are held down, NVDA provides commands to toggle the control, alt, shift, windows, and NVDA keys, along with commands for some combinations of those keys.
To use these toggles, first press the command (or sequence of commands) for the modifier keys you want pressed.
Then input the character that's part of the keyboard shortcut you want to input.
For example, to produce control+f, use the "Toggle control key" command and then type an f,
and to input control+alt+t, use either the "Toggle control key" and "Toggle alt key" commands, in either order, or the "Toggle control and alt keys" command, followed by typing a t.
</P>
<P>
If you accidentally toggle modifier keys, running the toggle command again will remove the modifier.
</P>
<P>
When typing in contracted Braille, using the modifier toggle keys will cause your input to be translated just as if you had pressed dots 7+8.
In addition, the emulated keypress cannot reflect Braille typed before the modifier key was pressed.
This means that, to type alt+2 with a Braille code that uses a number sign, you must first toggle Alt and then type a number sign.
</P>
<A NAME="Vision"></A>
<H2>9. Vision</H2>
<P>
While NVDA is primarily aimed at blind or vision impaired people who primarily use speech and/or braille to operate a computer, it also provides built-in facilities to change the contents of the screen.
Within NVDA, such a visual aid is called a vision enhancement provider.
</P>
<P>
NVDA offers several built-in vision enhancement providers which are described below.
Additional vision enhancement providers can be provided in <A HREF="#AddonsManager">NVDA add-ons</A>.
</P>
<P>
NVDA's vision settings can be changed in the <A HREF="#VisionSettings">vision category</A> of the <A HREF="#NVDASettings">NVDA Settings</A> dialog.
</P>
<A NAME="VisionFocusHighlight"></A>
<H3>9.1. Visual Highlight</H3>
<P>
Visual Highlight can help to identify the <A HREF="#SystemFocus">system focus</A>, <A HREF="#ObjectNavigation">navigator object</A> and <A HREF="#BrowseMode">browse mode</A> positions.
These positions are highlighted with a coloured rectangle outline.
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Solid blue highlights a combined navigator object and system focus location (e.g. because <A HREF="#ReviewCursorFollowFocus">the navigator object follows the system focus</A>).
<LI>Dashed blue highlights just the system focus object.
<LI>Solid pink highlights just the navigator object.
<LI>Solid yellow highlights the virtual caret used in browse mode (where there is no physical caret such as in web browsers).
</UL>

<P></P>
<P>
When Visual Highlight is enabled in the <A HREF="#VisionSettings">vision category</A> of the <A HREF="#NVDASettings">NVDA Settings</A> dialog, you can <A HREF="#VisionSettingsFocusHighlight">change whether or not to highlight the focus, navigator object or browse mode caret</A>.
</P>
<A NAME="VisionScreenCurtain"></A>
<H3>9.2. Screen Curtain</H3>
<P>
As a blind or vision impaired user, it is often not possible or necessary to see the contents of the screen.
Furthermore, it might be hard to ensure that there isn't someone looking over your shoulder.
For this situation, NVDA contains a feature called "Screen Curtain" which can be enabled to make the screen black.
</P>
<P>
You can enable the Screen Curtain in the <A HREF="#VisionSettings">vision category</A> of the <A HREF="#NVDASettings">NVDA Settings</A> dialog.
</P>
<P>
When the Screen Curtain is active some tasks directly based on what appears on the screen such as performing <A HREF="#Win10Ocr">OCR</A> or taking a screenshot cannot be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Due to a change in the Windows Magnification API, Screen Curtain had to be updated to support the newest versions of Windows.
Use NVDA 2021.2 to activate Screen Curtain with Windows 10 21H2 (10.0.19044) or later.
For security purposes, when using a new version of Windows, get visual confirmation that the Screen Curtain makes the screen entirely black.
</P>
<A NAME="ContentRecognition"></A>
<H2>10. Content Recognition</H2>
<P>
When authors don't provide sufficient information for a screen reader user to determine the content of something, various tools can be used to attempt to recognize the content from an image.
NVDA supports the optical character recognition (OCR) functionality built into Windows 10 and later to recognize text from images.
Additional content recognizers can be provided in NVDA add-ons.
</P>
<P>
When you use a content recognition command, NVDA recognizes content from the current <A HREF="#ObjectNavigation">navigator object</A>.
By default, the navigator object follows the system focus or browse mode cursor, so you can usually just move the focus or browse mode cursor where desired.
For example, if you move the browse mode cursor to a graphic, recognition will recognize content from the graphic by default.
However, you may wish to use object navigation directly to, for example, recognize the content of an entire application window.
</P>
<P>
Once recognition is complete, the result will be presented in a document similar to browse mode, allowing you to read the information with cursor keys, etc.
Pressing enter or space will activate (normally click) the text at the cursor if possible.
Pressing escape dismisses the recognition result.
</P>
<A NAME="Win10Ocr"></A>
<H3>10.1. Windows OCR</H3>
<P>
Windows 10 and later includes OCR for many languages.
NVDA can use this to recognize text from images or inaccessible applications.
</P>
<P>
You can set the language to use for text recognition in the <A HREF="#Win10OcrSettings">Windows OCR category</A> of the <A HREF="#NVDASettings">NVDA Settings</A> dialog.
Additional languages can be installed by opening the Start menu, choosing Settings, selecting Time &amp; Language -&gt; Region &amp; Language and then choosing Add a language.
</P>
<P>
Windows OCR may be partially or fully incompatible with <A HREF="#Vision">NVDA vision enhancements</A> or other external visual aids. You will need to disable these aids before proceeding to a recognition.
</P>
<P>
To recognize the text in the current navigator object using Windows OCR, press NVDA+r.
</P>
<A NAME="ApplicationSpecificFeatures"></A>
<H2>11. Application Specific Features</H2>
<P>
NVDA provides its own extra features  for some applications to make certain tasks easier or to provide access to functionality which is not otherwise accessible to screen reader users.
</P>
<A NAME="MicrosoftWord"></A>
<H3>11.1. Microsoft Word</H3>
<A NAME="WordAutomaticColumnAndRowHeaderReading"></A>
<H4>11.1.1. Automatic Column and Row Header Reading</H4>
<P>
NVDA is able to automatically announce appropriate row and column headers when navigating around tables in Microsoft Word.
This firstly requires that the Report Table row / column headers option in NVDA's Document Formatting settings, found in the <A HREF="#NVDASettings">NVDA Settings</A> dialog, be turned on.
Secondly, NVDA needs to know which row or column contains the headers in any given table.
After moving to the first cell in the column or row containing the headers, use one of the following commands:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="4">
<TR>
<TH>Name</TH>
<TH>Key</TH>
<TH>Description</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Set column headers</TD>
<TD>NVDA+shift+c</TD>
<TD>Pressing this once tells NVDA this is the first header cell in the row that contains column headers, which should be automatically announced when moving between columns below this row. Pressing twice will clear the setting.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Set row headers</TD>
<TD>NVDA+shift+r</TD>
<TD>Pressing this once tells NVDA this is the first header cell in the column that contains row headers, which should be automatically announced when moving between rows after  this column. Pressing twice will clear the setting.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
These settings will be stored in the document as bookmarks compatible with other screen readers such as JAWS.
This means that users of other screen readers who open this document at a later date will automatically  have the row and column headers already set.
</P>
<A NAME="BrowseModeInMicrosoftWord"></A>
<H4>11.1.2. Browse Mode in Microsoft Word</H4>
<P>
Similar to the web, Browse mode can be used in Microsoft Word to allow you to use features such as Quick navigation and the Elements List.
To toggle Browse mode on and off in Microsoft Word, press NVDA+space.
For further information about Browse mode and Quick Navigation, see the <A HREF="#BrowseMode">Browse Mode section</A>.
</P>
<A NAME="WordElementsList"></A>
<H5>11.1.2.1. The Elements List</H5>
<P>
While in Browse mode in Microsoft Word, you can access the Elements List by pressing NVDA+f7.
The Elements List can list headings, links, annotations (which includes comments and track changes) and errors (currently limited to spelling errors).
</P>
<A NAME="WordReportingComments"></A>
<H4>11.1.3. Reporting Comments</H4>
<P>
To report any comments at the current caret position, press NVDA+alt+c.
All comments for the document, along with other tracked changes, can also be listed in the NVDA Elements List  when selecting Annotations as the type.
</P>
<A NAME="MicrosoftExcel"></A>
<H3>11.2. Microsoft Excel</H3>
<A NAME="ExcelAutomaticColumnAndRowHeaderReading"></A>
<H4>11.2.1. Automatic Column and Row Header Reading</H4>
<P>
NVDA is able to automatically announce appropriate row and column headers when navigating around Excel worksheets.
This firstly requires that the Report Table row / column headers option in NVDA's Document Formatting settings, found in the <A HREF="#NVDASettings">NVDA Settings</A> dialog, be turned on.
Secondly, NVDA needs to know which row or column contains the headers.
After moving to the first cell in the column or row containing the headers, use one of the following commands:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="4">
<TR>
<TH>Name</TH>
<TH>Key</TH>
<TH>Description</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Set column headers</TD>

</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Set row headers</TD>
<TD>NVDA+shift+r</TD>
<TD>Pressing this once tells NVDA this is the first header cell in the column that contains row headers, which should be automatically announced when moving between rows after  this column. Pressing twice will clear the setting.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
These settings will be stored in the workbook as defined name ranges compatible with other screen readers such as JAWS.
This means that users of other screen readers who open this workbook at a later date will automatically  have the row and column headers already set. 
</P>
<A NAME="ExcelElementsList"></A>
<H4>11.2.2. The Elements List</H4>
<P>
Similar to the web, NVDA has an Elements List for Microsoft Excel that allows you to list and access several different types of information.
To access the Elements List in Excel, press NVDA+f7.
The various types of information available in the Elements List are:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Charts: This lists all charts in the active worksheet. 
Selecting a chart and pressing enter or the Move to button focuses the chart for navigating and reading with the arrow keys.
<LI>Comments: This lists all cells in the active worksheet containing comments. 
The cell address along with its comments are shown for each cell. 
Pressing enter or the Move To button when on a listed comment will move directly to that cell.
<LI>Formulas: This lists all cells in the worksheet containing a formula. 
The cell address along with its formula are shown for each cell.
Pressing enter or the Move To button on a listed formula will move directly to that cell. 
<LI>Sheets: This lists all sheets in the workbook. 
Pressing f2 when on a listed sheet allows you to rename the sheet. 
Pressing enter or the Move To button while on the listed sheet will switch to that sheet.
<LI>Form fields: This lists all form fields in the active worksheet.
For each form field, the Elements List shows the alternative text of the field along with the addresses of the cells it covers.
Selecting a form field and pressing enter or the Move to button moves to that field in browse mode.
</UL>

<P></P>
<A NAME="ExcelReportingComments"></A>
<H4>11.2.3. Reporting Notes</H4>
<P>
To report any notes for the currently focused cell, press NVDA+alt+c.
In Microsoft 2016, 365 and newer, the classic comments in Microsoft Excel have been renamed to "notes".
All notes for the worksheet can also be listed in the NVDA Elements List after pressing NVDA+f7.
</P>
<P>
NVDA can also display a specific dialog for adding or editing a certain note.
NVDA overrides the native MS Excel notes editing region due to accessibility constraints, but the key stroke for displaying the dialog is inherited from MS Excel and therefore works also without NVDA running.
To add or edit a certain note, in a focused cell, press shift+f2.
</P>
<P>
This key stroke does not appear and cannot be changed in NVDA's input gesture dialog.
</P>
<P>
Note: it is possible to open the note editing region in MS Excel also from the context menu of any cell of the work sheet.
However, this will open the inaccessible note editing region and not the NVDA specific note editing dialog.
</P>
<P>
In Microsoft Office 2016, 365 and newer, a new style comment dialog has been added.
This dialog is accessible and provides more features such as replying to comments, etc.
It can also be opened from the context menu of a certain cell.
The comments added to the cells via the new style comment dialog are not related to "notes".
</P>
<A NAME="ExcelReadingProtectedCells"></A>
<H4>11.2.4. Reading Protected Cells</H4>
<P>
If a workbook has been protected, it may not be possible to move focus to particular cells that have been locked for editing.
To allow moving to locked cells, switch to Browse Mode by pressing NVDA+space, and then use standard Excel movement commands such as the arrow keys to move around all cells on the current worksheet.
</P>
<A NAME="ExcelFormFields"></A>
<H4>11.2.5. Form Fields</H4>
<P>
Excel worksheets can include form fields.
You can access these using the Elements List or the f and shift+f form field single letter navigation keys.
Once you move to a form field in browse mode, you can press enter or space to either activate it or switch to focus mode so you can interact with it, depending on the control.
For further information about Browse mode and single letter navigation, see the <A HREF="#BrowseMode">Browse Mode section</A>.

<H3>11.9. Windows Console</H3>
<P>
NVDA provides support for the Windows command console used by Command Prompt, PowerShell, and the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
The console window is of fixed size, typically much smaller than the buffer that holds the output.
As new text is written, the content scroll upwards and previous text is no longer visible. 
On Windows versions before Windows 11 22H2, text in the console that is not visibly displayed in the window is not accessible with NVDA's text review commands.
Therefore, it is necessary to scroll the console window to read earlier text.
In newer versions of the console and in Windows Terminal, it is possible to review the entire text buffer freely without the need to scroll the window.
The following built-in Windows Console keyboard shortcuts may be useful when <A HREF="#ReviewingText">reviewing text</A> with NVDA in older versions of Windows Console:

<P>
This information greatly aides NV Access to prioritize future development of NVDA.
</P>
<A NAME="GeneralSettingsNotifyPendingUpdates"></A>
<H5>Notify for pending updates on startup</H5>
<P>
If this is enabled, NVDA will inform you when there is a pending update on startup, offering you the possibility to install it.
You can also manually install the pending update from the Exit NVDA dialog (if enabled),  from the NVDA menu, or when you perform a new check from the Help menu.
</P>
<A NAME="SpeechSettings"></A>
<H4>12.1.2. Speech Settings (NVDA+control+v)</H4>
<P>
The Speech category in the NVDA Settings dialog contains options that lets you change the speech synthesizer as well as voice characteristics for the chosen synthesizer.
For a quicker alternative way of controlling speech parameters from anywhere, please see the <A HREF="#SynthSettingsRing">Synth Settings Ring</A> section.
</P>
<P>
The Speech Settings category contains the following options:
</P>
<A NAME="SpeechSettingsChange"></A>
<H5>Change synthesizer</H5>
<P>
The first option in the Speech Settings category is the Change... button. This button activates the <A HREF="#SelectSynthesizer">Select Synthesizer</A> dialog, which allows you to select the active speech synthesizer and output device.
This dialog opens on top of the NVDA Settings dialog.
Saving or dismissing the settings in the Select Synthesizer dialog will return you to the NVDA Settings dialog.
</P>
<A NAME="SpeechSettingsVoice"></A>
<H5>Voice</H5>
<P>
The Voice option is a combo box listing all the voices of the current synthesizer that you have installed.
You can use the arrow keys to listen to all the various choices.
Left and Up arrow take you up in the list, while right and down arrow move you down in the list.
</P>
<A NAME="SpeechSettingsVariant"></A>
<H5>Variant</H5>
<P>
If you are using the Espeak NG synthesizer which is packaged with NVDA, this is a combo box that allows you to select the Variant the synthesizer should speak with.
ESpeak NG's Variants are rather like voices, as they provide slightly different attributes to the eSpeak NG voice.
Some variants will sound like a male, some like a female, and some even like a frog.
If using a third-party synthesizer, you may also be able to change this value if your chosen voice supports it.
</P>
<A NAME="SpeechSettingsRate"></A>
<H5>Rate</H5>
<P>
This option allows you to change the rate of your voice.
This is a slider that goes from 0 to 100 - 0 being the slowest, 100 being the fastest.
</P>
<A NAME="SpeechSettingsRateBoost"></A>
<H5>Rate boost</H5>
<P>
Enabling this option will significantly increase the speech rate, if supported by the current synthesizer.
</P>
<A NAME="SpeechSettingsPitch"></A>
<H5>Pitch</H5>
<P>
This option allows you to change the pitch of the current voice.
It is a slider which goes from 0 to 100 - 0 being the lowest pitch and 100 being the highest.
</P>
<A NAME="SpeechSettingsVolume"></A>
<H5>Volume</H5>
<P>
This option is a slider which goes from 0 to 100 - 0 being the lowest volume and 100 being the highest.
</P>
<A NAME="SpeechSettingsInflection"></A>
<H5>Inflection</H5>
<P>
This option is a slider that lets you choose how much inflection (rise and fall in pitch) the synthesizer should use to speak with.
</P>
<A NAME="SpeechSettingsLanguageSwitching"></A>
<H5>Automatic Language switching</H5>
<P>
This checkbox allows you to toggle whether NVDA should switch speech synthesizer languages automatically if the text being read specifies its language.
This option is enabled by default.
</P>
<A NAME="SpeechSettingsDialectSwitching"></A>
<H5>Automatic Dialect switching</H5>
<P>
This checkbox allows you to toggle whether or not dialect changes should be made, rather than just actual language changes.
For example, if reading in an English U.S. voice but a document specifies that some text is in English U.K., then the synthesizer will switch accents if this option is enabled.
This option is disabled by default.
</P>
<A NAME="SpeechSettingsSymbolLevel"></A>
<H5>Punctuation/Symbol Level</H5>
<P>
Key: NVDA+p
</P>
<P>
This allows you to choose the amount of punctuation and other symbols that should be spoken as words.
For example, when set to all, all symbols will be spoken as words.
This option applies to all synthesizers, not just the currently active synthesizer.
</P>
<A NAME="SpeechSettingsTrust"></A>
<H5>Trust voice's language when processing characters and symbols</H5>
<P>
On by default, this option tells NVDA if the current voice's language can be trusted when processing symbols and characters.
If you find that NVDA is reading punctuation in the wrong language for a particular synthesizer or voice, you may wish to turn this off to force NVDA to use its global language setting instead.
</P>
<A NAME="SpeechSettingsCLDR"></A>
<H5>Include Unicode Consortium data (including emoji) when processing characters and symbols</H5>
<P>
When this checkbox is checked, NVDA will include additional symbol pronunciation dictionaries when pronouncing characters and symbols.
These dictionaries contain descriptions for symbols (particularly emoji) that are provided by the <A HREF="https://www.unicode.org/consortium/">Unicode Consortium</A> as part of their <A HREF="http://cldr.unicode.org/">Common Locale Data Repository</A>.
If you want NVDA to speak descriptions of emoji characters based on this data, you should enable this option.
However, if you are using a speech synthesizer that supports speaking emoji descriptions natively, you may wish to turn this off.
</P>
<P>
Note that manually added or edited character descriptions are saved as part of your user settings.
Therefore, if you change the description of a particular emoji, your custom description will be spoken for that emoji regardless of whether this option is enabled.
You can add, edit or remove symbol descriptions in NVDA's <A HREF="#SymbolPronunciation">punctuation/symbol pronunciation dialog</A>.
</P>
<P>
To toggle Unicode Consortium data inclusion from anywhere, please assign a custom gesture using the <A HREF="#InputGestures">Input Gestures dialog</A>.
</P>
<A NAME="SpeechSettingsCapPitchChange"></A>
<H5>Capital pitch change percentage</H5>
<P>
This edit field allows you to type the amount that the pitch of the voice will change when speaking a capital letter.
This value is a percentage, where a negative value lowers the pitch and a positive value raises it.
For no pitch change you would use 0.
Usually, NVDA raises the pitch slightly for any capital letter, but some synthesizers may not support this well.
In case pitch change for capitals is not supported, consider <A HREF="#SpeechSettingsSayCapBefore">Say "cap" before capitals</A> and/or <A HREF="#SpeechSettingsBeepForCaps"> Beep for capitals</A> instead.
</P>
<A NAME="SpeechSettingsSayCapBefore"></A>
<H5>Say "cap" before capitals</H5>
<P>
This setting is a checkbox that, when checked, tells NVDA to say the word "cap" before any capital letter when spoken as an individual character such as when spelling.
</P>
<A NAME="SpeechSettingsBeepForCaps"></A>
<H5>Beep for capitals</H5>
<P>
If this checkbox is checked, NVDA will make a small beep each time it encounters a capitalized character by itself.
</P>
<A NAME="SpeechSettingsUseSpelling"></A>
<H5>Use spelling functionality if supported</H5>
<P>
Some words consist of only one character, but the pronunciation is different depending on whether the character is being spoken as an individual character (such as when spelling) or a word.
For example, in English, "a" is both a letter and a word and is pronounced differently in each case.
This option allows the synthesizer to differentiate between these two cases if the synthesizer supports this.
Most synthesizers do support it.
</P>
<P>
This option should generally be enabled.
However, some Microsoft Speech API synthesizers do not implement this correctly and behave strangely when it is enabled.
If you are having problems with the pronunciation of individual characters, try disabling this option.
</P>
<A NAME="delayedCharacterDescriptions"></A>
<H5>Delayed descriptions for characters on cursor movement</H5>
<DL>
<DT>Default</DT><DD>
  Disabled
<DT>Options</DT><DD>
  Enabled, Disabled
</DL>

<P></P>
<P>
When this setting is checked, NVDA will say the character description when you move by characters.
</P>
<P>
For example, while reviewing a line by characters, when the letter "b" is read NVDA will say "Bravo" after a 1 second delay.
This can be useful if it is hard to distinguish between pronunciation of symbols, or for hearing impaired users.
</P>
<P>
The delayed character description will be cancelled if other text is spoken during that time, or if you press the <CODE>control</CODE> key.
</P>
<A NAME="SelectSynthesizer"></A>
<H4>12.1.3. Select Synthesizer (NVDA+control+s)</H4>
<P>
The Synthesizer dialog, which can be opened by activating the Change... button in the speech category of the NVDA settings dialog, allows you to select which Synthesizer NVDA should use to speak with.
Once you have selected your synthesizer of choice, you can press Ok and NVDA will load the selected Synthesizer.
If there is an error loading the synthesizer, NVDA will notify you with a message, and continue using the previous synthesizer.
</P>
<A NAME="SelectSynthesizerSynthesizer"></A>
<H5>Synthesizer</H5>
<P>
This option allows you to choose the synthesizer you wish NVDA to use for speech output.
</P>
<P>
For a list of the Synthesizers that NVDA supports, please see the <A HREF="#SupportedSpeechSynths">Supported Speech Synthesizers</A> section.
</P>
<P>
One special item that will always appear in this list is "No speech", which allows you to use NVDA with no speech output whatsoever.
This may be useful for someone who wishes to only use NVDA with braille, or perhaps to sighted developers who only wish to use the Speech Viewer.
</P>
<A NAME="SelectSynthesizerOutputDevice"></A>
<H5>Output device</H5>
<P>
This option allows you to choose the audio device that NVDA should instruct the selected synthesizer to speak through.
</P>
<A NAME="SelectSynthesizerDuckingMode"></A>
<H5>Audio Ducking Mode</H5>
<P>
Key: NVDA+shift+d
</P>
<P>
On Windows 8 and above, this option allows you to choose if NVDA should lower the volume of other applications while NVDA is speaking, or all the time while NVDA is running.
</P>
<UL>
<LI>No Ducking: NVDA will never lower the volume of other audio. 
<LI>Duck when outputting speech and sounds: NVDA will only lower the volume of other audio when NVDA is speaking or playing sounds. This may not work for all synthesizers. 
<LI>Always duck: NVDA will keep the volume of other audio lower the whole time NVDA is running.
</UL>

<P></P>
<P>
This option is only available if NVDA has been installed.
It is not possible to support audio ducking for portable and temporary copies of NVDA.

Saving or dismissing the settings in the Select Braille Display dialog will return you to the NVDA Settings dialog.
</P>
<A NAME="BrailleSettingsOutputTable"></A>
<H5>Output Table</H5>
<P>
The next option you will come to in this category is the braille output table combo box.
In this combo box, you will find braille tables for different languages, braille standards and grades.
The chosen table will be used to translate text into braille to be presented on your braille display.
You can move from braille table to braille table in the list by using the arrow keys.
</P>
<A NAME="BrailleSettingsInputTable"></A>
<H5>Input Table</H5>
<P>
Complementary to the previous option, the next setting you will find is the braille input table combo box.
The chosen table will be used to translate braille entered on your braille display's Perkins-style keyboard into text.
You can move from braille table to braille table in the list by using the arrow keys.
</P>
<P>
Note that this option is only useful if your braille display has a Perkins-style keyboard and this feature is supported by the braille display driver.
If input is not supported on a display which does have a braille keyboard, this will be noted in the <A HREF="#SupportedBrailleDisplays">Supported Braille Displays</A> section.
</P>
<A NAME="BrailleSettingsExpandToComputerBraille"></A>
<H5>Expand to computer braille for the word at the cursor</H5>
<P>
This option allows the word that is under the cursor to be displayed in non-contracted computer braille.
</P>
<A NAME="BrailleSettingsShowCursor"></A>
<H5>Show Cursor</H5>
<P>
This option allows the braille cursor to be turned on and off.
It applies to the system caret and review cursor, but not to the selection indicator.
</P>
<A NAME="BrailleSettingsBlinkCursor"></A>
<H5>Blink Cursor</H5>
<P>
This option allows the braille cursor to blink.
If blinking is turned off, the braille cursor will constantly be in the "up" position.
The selection indicator is not affected by this option, it is always dots 7 and 8 without blinking.
</P>
<A NAME="BrailleSettingsBlinkRate"></A>
<H5>Cursor Blink Rate (ms)</H5>
<P>
This option is a numerical field that allows you to change the blink rate of the cursor in milliseconds.
</P>
<A NAME="BrailleSettingsCursorShapeForFocus"></A>
<H5>Cursor Shape for Focus</H5>
<P>
This option allows you to choose the shape (dot pattern) of the braille cursor when braille is tethered to focus.
The selection indicator is not affected by this option, it is always dots 7 and 8 without blinking.
</P>
<A NAME="BrailleSettingsCursorShapeForReview"></A>
<H5>Cursor Shape for Review</H5>
<P>
This option allows you to choose the shape (dot pattern) of the braille cursor when braille is tethered to review.

<P>
Key: NVDA+control+t
</P>
<P>
This option allows you to choose whether the braille display will follow the system focus / caret, the navigator object / review cursor, or both.
When "automatically" is selected, NVDA will follow the system focus and caret by default.
In this case, when the navigator object or the review cursor position is changed by means of explicit user interaction, NVDA will tether to review temporarily, until the focus or the caret changes.
If you want it to follow the focus and caret only, you need to configure braille to be tethered to focus.
In this case, braille will not follow the NVDA navigator during object navigation or the review cursor during review.
If you want braille to follow object navigation and text review instead, you need to configure braille to be tethered to review.
In this case, Braille  will not follow system focus and system caret.
</P>
<A NAME="BrailleSettingsReadByParagraph"></A>
<H5>Read by Paragraph</H5>
<P>
If enabled, braille will be displayed by paragraphs instead of lines.
Also, the next and previous line commands will move by paragraph accordingly.
This means that you do not have to scroll the display at the end of each line even where more text would fit on the display.
This may allow for more fluent reading of large amounts of text.
It is disabled by default.
</P>
<A NAME="BrailleSettingsWordWrap"></A>
<H5>Avoid splitting words when possible</H5>
<P>
If this is enabled, a word which is too large to fit at the end of the braille display will not be split.
Instead, there will be some blank space at the end of the display.
When you scroll the display, you will be able to read the entire word.
This is sometimes called "word wrap".
Note that if the word is too large to fit on the display even by itself, the word must still be split.
</P>
<P>
If this is disabled, as much of the word as possible will be displayed, but the rest will be cut off.
When you scroll the display, you will then be able to read the rest of the word.
</P>
<P>
Enabling this may allow for more fluent reading, but generally requires you to scroll the display more.
</P>
<A NAME="BrailleSettingsFocusContextPresentation"></A>
<H5>Focus context presentation</H5>
<P>
This option allows you to choose what context information NVDA will show on the braille display when an object gets focus.
Context information refers to the hierarchy of objects containing the focus.
For example, when you focus a list item, this list item is part of a list.
This list might be contained by a dialog, etc.
Please consult the section about <A HREF="#ObjectNavigation">object navigation</A> for more information about the hierarchy that applies to objects in NVDA.
</P>
<P>
When set to fill display for context changes, NVDA will try to display as much context information as possible on the braille display, but only for the parts of the context that have changed.
For the example above, this means that when changing focus to the list, NVDA will show the list item on the braille display.
Furthermore, if there is enough space left on the braille display, NVDA will try to show that the list item is part of a list.
If you then start moving through the list with your arrow keys, it is assumed that you are aware that you are still in the list.
Thus, for the remaining list items you focus, NVDA will only show the focused list item on the display.
In order for you to read the context again (i.e. that you are in a list and that the list is part of a dialog), you will have to scroll your braille display back.
</P>
<P>
When this option is set to always fill the display, NVDA will try to show as much context information as possible on the braille display, regardless of whether you have seen the same context information before.
This has the advantage that NVDA will fit as much information as possible on the display.
However, the downside is that there is always a difference in the position where the focus starts on the braille display.
This can make it difficult to skim a long list of items, for example, as you will need to continually move your finger to find the start of the item.
This was the default behaviour for NVDA 2017.2 and before.
</P>
<P>
When you set the focus context presentation option to only show the context information when scrolling back, NVDA never shows context information on your braille display by default.
Thus, in the example above, NVDA will display that you focused a list item.
However, in order for you to read the context (i.e. that you are in a list and that the list is part of a dialog), you will have to scroll your braille display back.
</P>
<P>
To toggle focus context presentation from anywhere, please assign a custom gesture using the <A HREF="#InputGestures">Input Gestures dialog</A>.
</P>
<A NAME="BrailleSettingsInterruptSpeech"></A>
<H5>Interrupt speech while scrolling</H5>
<DL>
<DT>Default</DT><DD>
  Enabled
<DT>Options</DT><DD>
  Default (Enabled), Enabled, Disabled
</DL>

<P></P>
<P>
This setting determines if speech should be interrupted when the Braille display is scrolled backwards/forwards.
Previous/next line commands always interrupt speech.
</P>
<P>
On-going speech might be a distraction while reading Braille.
For this reason the option is enabled by default, interrupting speech when scrolling braille.
</P>
<P>
Disabling this option allows speech to be heard while simultaneously reading Braille.
</P>
<A NAME="SelectBrailleDisplay"></A>
<H4>12.1.6. Select Braille Display (NVDA+control+a)</H4>
<P>
The Select Braille Display dialog, which can be opened by activating the Change... button in the Braille category of the NVDA settings dialog, allows you to select which Braille display NVDA should use for braille output.
Once you have selected your braille display of choice, you can press Ok and NVDA will load the selected display.
If there is an error loading the display driver, NVDA will notify you with a message, and continue using the previous display, if any.
</P>
<A NAME="SelectBrailleDisplayDisplay"></A>
<H5>Braille Display</H5>
<P>
This combo box presents you with several options depending on what braille display drivers are available on your system.
Move between these options with the arrow keys.
</P>
<P>
The automatic option will allow NVDA to search for many supported braille displays in the background.
When this feature is enabled and you connect a supported display using USB or bluetooth, NVDA will automatically connect with this display.
</P>
<P>
No braille means that you are not using braille.
</P>
<P>
Please see the <A HREF="#SupportedBrailleDisplays">Supported Braille Displays</A> section for more information about supported braille displays and which of these support automatic detection in the background.
</P>
<A NAME="SelectBrailleDisplayPort"></A>
<H5>Port</H5>
<P>
This option, if available, allows you to choose what port or type of connection will be used to communicate with the braille display you have selected.
It is a combo box containing the possible choices for your braille display.
</P>
<P>
By default, NVDA employs automatic port detection, which means the connection with the braille device will be established automatically by scanning for available USB and bluetooth devices on your system.
However, for some braille displays, you may be able to explicitly choose what port should be used.
Common options are "Automatic" (which tells NVDA to employ the default automatic port selection procedure), "USB", "Bluetooth" and legacy serial communication ports if your braille display supports this type of communication.
</P>
<P>
This option won't be available if your braille display only supports automatic port detection.
</P>
<P>
You may consult the documentation for your braille display in the section <A HREF="#SupportedBrailleDisplays">Supported Braille Displays</A> to check for more details on the supported types of communication and available ports.
</P>
<P>
Please note: If you connect multiple Braille Displays to your machine at the same time which use the same driver (E.g. connecting two Seika displays),
it is currently impossible to tell NVDA which display to use.
Therefore it is recommended to only connect one Braille Display of a given type / manufacturer to your machine at a time.
</P>

<A NAME="KeyboardSettingsBeepLowercase"></A>
<H5>Beep if Typing Lowercase Letters when Caps Lock is On</H5>
<P>
When enabled, a warning beep will be heard if a letter is typed with the shift key while Caps Lock is on.
Generally, typing shifted letters with Caps Lock is unintentional and is usually due to not realizing that Caps Lock is enabled.
Therefore, it can be quite helpful to be warned about this.
</P>
<A NAME="KeyboardSettingsSpeakCommandKeys"></A>
<H5>Speak Command Keys</H5>
<P>
Key: NVDA+4

</P>
<A NAME="MouseSettingsTracking"></A>
<H5>Enable mouse tracking</H5>
<P>
Key: NVDA+m
</P>
<P>
When enabled, NVDA will announce the text currently under the mouse pointer, as you move it around the screen. This allows you to find things on the screen, by physically moving the mouse, rather than trying to find them through object navigation.
</P>

</P>
<A NAME="MouseSettingsAudio"></A>
<H5>Play audio coordinates when mouse moves</H5>
<P>
Checking this checkbox makes NVDA play beeps as the mouse moves, so that the user can work out where the mouse is in regards to the dimensions of the screen.
The higher the mouse is on the screen, the higher the pitch of the beeps.
The further left or right the mouse is located on the screen, the further left or right the sound will be played (assuming the user has stereo speakers or headphones).
</P>
<A NAME="MouseSettingsBrightness"></A>
<H5>Brightness controls audio coordinates volume</H5>
<P>
If the "play audio coordinates when mouse moves" checkbox is checked, then checking this checkbox means that the volume of the audio coordinates beeps is controlled by how bright the screen is under the mouse.

</P>
<A NAME="ObjectPresentationGuessPositionInfo"></A>
<H5>Guess Object Position Information when unavailable</H5>
<P>
If reporting of object position information is turned on, this option allows NVDA to guess object position information when it is otherwise unavailable for a particular control.
</P>
<P>
When on, NVDA will report position information for more controls such as menus and toolbars, however this information may be slightly inaccurate.
</P>
<A NAME="ObjectPresentationReportDescriptions"></A>
<H5>Report Object descriptions</H5>
<P>
Uncheck this checkbox if you don't wish to have the description reported along with objects (i.e. search suggestions, reporting of whole dialog window right after the dialog opens, etc.).
</P>
<A NAME="ObjectPresentationProgressBarOutput"></A>
<H5>Progress bar output</H5>
<P>
Key: NVDA+u
</P>
<P>
This option controls how NVDA reports progress bar updates to you.
</P>
<P>
It has the following options:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Off: Progress bars will not be reported as they change.
<LI>Speak: This option tells NVDA to speak the progress bar in percentages. Each time the progress bar changes, NVDA will speak the new value.
<LI>Beep: This tells NVDA to beep each time the progress bar changes. The higher the beep, the closer the progress bar is to completion.
<LI>Beep and speak: This option tells NVDA to both beep and speak when a progress bar updates.
</UL>

<P></P>
<A NAME="ObjectPresentationReportBackgroundProgressBars"></A>
<H5>Report background progress bars</H5>
<P>
This is an option that, when checked, tells NVDA to keep reporting a progress bar, even if it is not physically in the foreground.
If you minimize or switch away from a window that contains a progress bar, NVDA will keep track of it, allowing you to do other things while NVDA tracks the progress bar.
</P>
<A NAME="ObjectPresentationReportDynamicContent"></A>
<H5>Report dynamic content changes</H5>
<P>
Key: NVDA+5
</P>
<P>
Toggles the announcement of new content in particular objects such as terminals and the history control in chat programs.
</P>
<A NAME="ObjectPresentationSuggestionSounds"></A>
<H5>Play a sound when auto-suggestions appear</H5>
<P>
Toggles announcement of appearance of auto-suggestions, and if enabled, NVDA will play a sound to indicate this.
Auto-suggestions are lists of suggested entries based on text entered into certain edit fields and documents.
For example, when you enter text into the search box in Start menu in Windows Vista and later, Windows displays a list of suggestions based on what you typed.
For some edit fields such as search fields in various Windows 10 apps, NVDA can notify you that a list of suggestions has appeared when you type text.
The auto-suggestions list will close once you move away from the edit field, and for some fields, NVDA can notify you of this when this happens.
</P>
<A NAME="InputCompositionSettings"></A>
<H4>12.1.13. Input Composition</H4>
<P>
The Input Composition category allows you to control how NVDA reports the input of Asian characters, such as with IME or Text Service input methods.
Note that due to the fact that input methods vary greatly by available features and by how they convey information, it will most likely be necessary to configure these options differently for each input method to get the most efficient typing experience.
</P>
<A NAME="InputCompositionReportAllCandidates"></A>
<H5>Automatically report all available candidates</H5>
<P>
This option, which is on by default,  allows you to choose whether or not all visible candidates should be reported automatically when a candidate list appears or its page is changed.
Having this option on for pictographic input methods such as Chinese New ChangJie or Boshiami is useful, as you can automatically hear all symbols and their numbers and you can choose one right away.
However, for phonetic input methods such as Chinese New Phonetic, it may be more useful to turn this option off, as all the symbols will sound the same and you will have to use the arrow keys to navigate the list items individually to gain more information  from the character descriptions for each candidate.
</P>
<A NAME="InputCompositionAnnounceSelectedCandidate"></A>
<H5>Announce Selected Candidate</H5>
<P>
This option, which is on by default, allows you to choose whether NVDA should announce the selected candidate when a candidate list appears or when the selection is changed.
For input methods where the selection can be changed with the arrow keys  (such as Chinese New Phonetic) this is necessary, but for some input methods it may be more efficient typing with this option turned off.
Note that even with this option off, the review cursor will still be placed on the selected candidate allowing you to use object navigation / review to manually read this or other candidates.
</P>
<A NAME="InputCompositionCandidateIncludesShortCharacterDescription"></A>
<H5>Always include short character descriptions for candidates</H5>
<P>
This option, which is on by default, allows you to choose whether or not NVDA should provide a short description for each character in a candidate, either when it's selected or when it's automatically read when the candidate list appears.
Note that for locales such as Chinese, the announcement of extra character descriptions for the selected candidate is not affected by this option.
This option may be useful for Korean and Japanese input methods.
</P>
<A NAME="InputCompositionReadingStringChanges"></A>
<H5>Report changes to the reading string</H5>
<P>
Some input methods such as Chinese New Phonetic and New ChangJie have a reading string (sometimes known as a precomposition string).
You can choose whether or not NVDA should announce new characters being typed into this reading string with this option.
This option is on by default.
Note some older input methods such as Chinese ChangJie may not use the reading string to hold precomposition characters, but instead use the composition string directly. Please see the next option for configuring reporting of the composition string.
</P>
<A NAME="InputCompositionCompositionStringChanges"></A>
<H5>Report changes to the composition string</H5>
<P>
After reading or precomposition data has been combined into a valid pictographic symbol, most input methods place this symbol into a composition string for temporary storage along with other combined symbols before they are finally inserted into the document.
This option allows you to choose whether or not NVDA should report new symbols as they appear  in the composition string.
This option is on by default.
</P>
<A NAME="BrowseModeSettings"></A>
<H4>12.1.14. Browse Mode (NVDA+control+b)</H4>
<P>
The Browse Mode category in the NVDA Settings dialog is used to configure NVDA's behaviour when you read and navigate complex documents such as web pages.
This category contains the following options:
</P>
<A NAME="BrowseModeSettingsMaxLength"></A>
<H5>Maximum Number of Characters on One Line</H5>
<P>
This field sets the maximum length of a line in browse mode (in characters).
</P>
<A NAME="BrowseModeSettingsPageLines"></A>
<H5>Maximum Lines Per Page</H5>
<P>
This field sets the amount of lines you will move by when pressing page up or page down while in browse mode.
</P>
<A NAME="BrowseModeSettingsScreenLayout"></A>
<H5>Use screen layout</H5>
<P>
Key: NVDA+v
</P>
<P>
This option allows you to specify whether browse mode should place clickable content (links, buttons and fields) on its own line, or if it should keep it in the flow of text as it is visually shown.
Note that this option doesn't apply to Microsoft Office apps such as Outlook and Word, which always use screen layout.
When screen layout is enabled, page elements will stay as they are visually shown.
For example, a visual line of multiple links will be presented in speech and braille as multiple links on the same line.
If it is disabled, then page elements will be placed on their own lines.
This may be easier to understand during line by line page navigation and make items easier to interact with for some users.
</P>
<A NAME="BrowseModeSettingsEnableOnPageLoad"></A>
<H5>Enable browse mode on page load</H5>
<P>
This checkbox toggles whether browse mode should be automatically enabled when loading a page.
When this option is disabled, browse mode can still be manually activated on pages or in documents where browse mode is supported.
See the <A HREF="#BrowseMode">Browse Mode section</A> for a list of applications supported by browse mode.
Note that this option does not apply to situations where browse mode is always optional, e.g. in Microsoft Word.
This option is enabled by default.
</P>
<A NAME="BrowseModeSettingsAutoSayAll"></A>
<H5>Automatic Say All on page load</H5>
<P>
This checkbox toggles the automatic reading of a page after it loads in browse mode.
This option is enabled by default.
</P>
<A NAME="BrowseModeSettingsIncludeLayoutTables"></A>
<H5>Include layout tables</H5>
<P>
This option affects how NVDA handles tables used purely for layout purposes.
When on, NVDA will treat these as normal tables, reporting them based on <A HREF="#DocumentFormattingSettings">Document Formatting Settings</A> and locating them with quick navigation commands.
When off, they will not be reported nor found with quick navigation.
However, the content of the tables will still be included as normal text.
This option is turned off by default.
</P>
<P>
To toggle inclusion of layout tables from anywhere, please assign a custom gesture using the <A HREF="#InputGestures">Input Gestures dialog</A>.
</P>
<A NAME="BrowseModeLinksAndHeadings"></A>
<H5>Configuring reporting of fields such as links and headings</H5>
<P>
Please see the options in the <A HREF="#DocumentFormattingSettings">Document Formatting category</A> of the <A HREF="#NVDASettings">NVDA Settings</A> dialog to configure the fields that are reported when navigating, such as links, headings and tables.
</P>
<A NAME="BrowseModeSettingsAutoPassThroughOnFocusChange"></A>
<H5>Automatic focus mode for focus changes</H5>
<P>
This option allows focus mode to be invoked if focus changes.
For example, when on a web page, if you press tab and you land on a form, if this option is checked, focus mode will automatically be invoked.
</P>
<A NAME="BrowseModeSettingsAutoPassThroughOnCaretMove"></A>
<H5>Automatic focus mode for caret movement</H5>
<P>
This option, when checked, allows NVDA to enter and leave focus mode when using arrow keys.
For example, if arrowing down a web page and you land on an edit box, NVDA will automatically bring you into focus mode.
If you arrow out of the edit box, NVDA will put you back in browse mode.
</P>
<A NAME="BrowseModeSettingsPassThroughAudioIndication"></A>
<H5>Audio indication of Focus and Browse modes</H5>
<P>
If this option is enabled, NVDA will play special sounds when it switches between browse mode and focus mode, rather than speaking the change.
</P>
<A NAME="BrowseModeSettingsTrapNonCommandGestures"></A>
<H5>Trap non-command gestures from reaching the document</H5>
<P>
Enabled by default, this option allows you to choose if gestures (such as key presses) that  do not result in an NVDA command and are not considered to be a command key in general, should be trapped from going through to the document you are currently focused on. 
As an example, if enabled and the letter j was pressed, it would be trapped from reaching the document, even though it is not a quick navigation command nor is it likely to be a command in the application itself.
In this case NVDA will tell Windows to play a default sound whenever a key which gets trapped is pressed.
</P>
<A NAME="BrowseModeSettingsAutoFocusFocusableElements"></A>
<H5>Automatically set system focus to focusable elements</H5>
<P>
Key: NVDA+8
</P>
<P>
Disabled by default, this option allows you to choose if the system focus should automatically be set to elements that can take the system focus (links, form fields, etc.) when navigating content with the browse mode caret.
Leaving this option disabled will not automatically focus focusable elements when they are selected with the browse mode caret.
This might result in faster browsing experience and better responsiveness in browse mode.
The focus will yet be updated to the particular element when interacting with it (e.g. pressing a button, checking a check box).
Enabling this option may improve support for some websites at the cost of performance and stability.
</P>
<A NAME="DocumentFormattingSettings"></A>
<H4>12.1.15. Document Formatting (NVDA+control+d)</H4>
<P>
Most of the options in this category are for configuring what type of formatting you wish to have reported as you move the cursor around documents.
For example, if you check the report font name checkbox, each time you arrow onto text with a different font, the name of the font will be announced.
</P>

<A NAME="DocumentFormattingDetectFormatAfterCursor"></A>
<H5>Report formatting changes after the cursor</H5>
<P>
If enabled, this setting tells NVDA to try and detect all the formatting changes on a line as it reports it, even if doing this may slow down NVDA's performance.
</P>
<P>
By default, NVDA will detect the formatting at the position of the System caret / Review Cursor, and in some instances may detect formatting on the rest of the line, only if it is not going to cause a performance decrease.
</P>
<P>
Enable this option while proof reading documents in applications such as WordPad, where formatting is important.
</P>
<A NAME="DocumentFormattingSettingsLineIndentation"></A>
<H5>Line indentation reporting</H5>
<P>
This option allows you to configure how indentation at the beginning of lines is reported.
The Report line indentation with combo box has four options.
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Off: NVDA will not treat indentation specially.
<LI>Speech: If speech is selected, when the  amount of indentation changes, NVDA will say something like "twelve space" or "four tab."
<LI>Tones: If Tones is selected, when the  amount of  indentation changes, tones indicate the amount of change in indent.
The tone will increase in pitch every space, and for a tab, it will increase in pitch the equivalent of 4 spaces.
<LI>Both Speech and Tones: This option reads indentation using both of the above methods.
</UL>

<P></P>
<A NAME="DocumentNavigation"></A>
<H4>12.1.16. Document Navigation</H4>

  Handled by application
<DT>Options</DT><DD>
  Default (Handled by application), Handled by application, Single line break, Multi line break
</DL>

<P></P>
<P>
This combo box allows you to select the paragraph style to be used when navigating by paragraphs with <CODE>control+upArrow</CODE> and <CODE>control+downArrow</CODE>.
The available paragraph styles are:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Handled by application: NVDA will let the application determine the previous or next paragraph, and NVDA will read the new paragraph when navigating.
This style works best when the application supports paragraph navigation natively, and is the default.
<LI>Single line break: NVDA will attempt to determine the previous or next paragraph using a single line break as the paragraph indicator.
This style works best when reading documents in an application which does not natively support paragraph navigation, and paragraphs in the document are marked by a single press of the <CODE>enter</CODE> key.
<LI>Multi line break: NVDA will attempt to determine the previous or next paragraph using at least one blank line (two presses of the <CODE>enter</CODE> key) as the paragraph indicator.
This style works best when working with documents which use block paragraphs.
Note that this paragraph style cannot be used in Microsoft Word or Microsoft Outlook, unless you are using UIA to access Microsoft Word controls.
</UL>

<P></P>
<P>
You may toggle through the available paragraph styles from anywhere by assigning a key in the <A HREF="#InputGestures">Input Gestures dialog</A>.

In order to make changes to the advanced settings, the controls must be enabled by confirming, with the checkbox, that you understand the risks of modifying these settings
</P>
<A NAME="AdvancedSettingsRestoringDefaults"></A>
<H5>Restoring the default settings</H5>
<P>
The button restores the default values for the settings, even if the confirmation checkbox is not ticked.
After changing settings you may wish to revert to the default values.
This may also be the case if you are unsure if the settings have been changed.
</P>
<A NAME="AdvancedSettingsEnableScratchpad"></A>
<H5>Enable loading custom code from Developer Scratchpad Directory</H5>
<P>
When developing add-ons for NVDA, it is useful to be able to test code as you are writing it.
This option when enabled, allows NVDA to load custom appModules, globalPlugins, brailleDisplayDrivers and synthDrivers, from a special developer scratchpad directory in your NVDA user configuration directory.
Previously NVDA would load custom code directly from the user configuration directory, with no way of disabling this.
This option is off by default, ensuring that no untested code is ever run in NVDA with out the user's explicit knowledge.
If you wish to distribute custom code to others, you should package it as an NVDA add-on.
</P>
<A NAME="AdvancedSettingsOpenScratchpadDir"></A>
<H5>Open Developer Scratchpad Directory</H5>
<P>
This button opens the directory where you can place custom code while developing it.
This button is only enabled if NVDA is configured to enable loading custom code from the Developer Scratchpad Directory.

<A NAME="AdvancedSettingsSelectiveUIAEventRegistration"></A>
<H5>Registration for UI Automation events and property changes</H5>
<DL>
<DT>Default</DT><DD>
  Automatic
<DT>Options</DT><DD>
  Automatic, Selective, Global
</DL>

<P></P>
<P>
This option changes how NVDA registers for events fired by the Microsoft UI Automation accessibility API.
The registration for UI Automation events and property changes combo box has three options:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Automatic: "selective" on Windows 11 Sun Valley 2 (version 22H2) and later, "global" otherwise.
<LI>Selective: NVDA will limit event registration to the system focus for most events.
If you suffer from performance issues in one or more applications, We recommend you to try this functionality to see whether performance improves.
However, on older versions of Windows, NVDA may have trouble tracking focus in some controls (such as the task manager and emoji panel).
<LI>Global: NVDA registers for many UIA events that are processed and discarded within NVDA itself.
While focus tracking is more reliable in more situations, performance is significantly degraded, especially in applications like Microsoft Visual Studio.
</UL>

<P></P>
<A NAME="MSWordUIA"></A>
<H5>Use UI automation to access Microsoft Word document controls</H5>
<P>
Configures whether or not NVDA should use the UI Automation accessibility API to access Microsoft Word documents, rather than the older Microsoft Word object model.
This applies to documents in Microsoft word itself, plus messages in Microsoft Outlook.
This setting contains the following values:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Default (where suitable)
<LI>Only where necessary: where the Microsoft Word object model is not  available at all
<LI>Where suitable: Microsoft Word version 16.0.15000 or higher, or where the Microsoft Word object model is unavailable
<LI>Always: where ever UI automation is available in Microsoft word (no matter how complete).

<DT>Default</DT><DD>
  Automatic
<DT>Options</DT><DD>
  Automatic, UIA when available, Legacy
</DL>

<P></P>
<P>
This option selects how NVDA interacts with the Windows Console used by command prompt, PowerShell, and the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
It does not affect the modern Windows Terminal.
In Windows 10 version 1709, Microsoft <A HREF="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/whats-new-in-windows-console-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update/">added support for its UI Automation API to the console</A>, bringing vastly improved performance and stability for screen readers that support it.
In situations where UI Automation is unavailable or known to result in an inferior user experience, NVDA's legacy console support is available as a fallback.
The Windows Console support combo box has three options:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Automatic: Uses UI Automation in the version of Windows Console included with Windows 11 version 22H2 and later.
This option is recommended and set by default.
<LI>UIA when available: Uses UI Automation in consoles if available, even for versions with incomplete or buggy implementations.
While this limited functionality may be useful (and even sufficient for your usage), use of this option is entirely at your own risk and no support for it will be provided.
<LI>Legacy: UI Automation in the Windows Console will be completely disabled.
The legacy fallback will always be used even in situations where UI Automation would provide a superior user experience.
Therefore, selecting this option is not recommended unless you know what you are doing.
</UL>

<P></P>
<A NAME="ChromiumUIA"></A>
<H5>Use UIA with Microsoft Edge and other Chromium based browsers when available</H5>
<P>
Allows specifying when UIA will be used when it is available in Chromium based browsers such as Microsoft Edge.
UIA support for Chromium based browsers is early in development and may not provide the same level of access as IA2.
The combo box has the following options:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Default (Only when necessary): The NVDA default, currently this is "Only when necessary". This default may change in the future as the technology matures.
<LI>Only when necessary: When NVDA is unable to inject into the browser process in order to use IA2 and UIA is available, then NVDA will fall back to using UIA.
<LI>Yes: If the browser makes UIA available, NVDA will use it.
<LI>No: Don't use UIA, even if NVDA is unable to inject in process. This may be useful for developers debugging issues with IA2 and want to ensure that NVDA does not fall back to UIA.
</UL>

<P></P>
<A NAME="Annotations"></A>
<H5>Annotations</H5>
<P>
This group of options is used to enable features which add experimental support for ARIA annotations.
Some of these features may be incomplete.
</P>
<P>
To "Report summary of any annotation details at the system caret", press NVDA+d.
</P>
<P>
The following options exist: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>"Report 'has details' for structured annotations": enables reporting if the text or control has further details.
<LI>"Report aria-description always":
  When the source of <CODE>accDescription</CODE> is aria-description, the description is reported.
  This is useful for annotations on the web.
  Note:
  <UL>
  <LI>There are many sources for <CODE>accDescription</CODE> several have mixed or unreliable semantics.
    Historically AT has not been able to differentiate sources of <CODE>accDescription</CODE> typically it wasn't spoken due to the mixed semantics.
  <LI>This option is in very early development, it relies on browser features not yet widely available.
  <LI>Expected to work with Chromium 92.0.4479.0+
  </UL>
</UL>

<P></P>
<A NAME="UseUiaForExcel"></A>
<H5>Use UI automation to access Microsoft  Excel spreadsheet controls when available</H5>
<P>
When this option is enabled, NVDA will try to use the Microsoft UI Automation accessibility API in order to fetch information from Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet controls.
This is an experimental feature, and some features of Microsoft Excel may not be available in this mode.
For instance, NVDA's Elements List for listing formulas and comments, and Browse mode quick navigation to jump to form fields on a spreadsheet features are not available.
However, for basic spreadsheet navigating / editing, this option may provide a vast performance improvement.
We still do not recommend that  the majority of users turn this on by default, though we do welcome users of Microsoft Excel  build 16.0.13522.10000 or higher to test this feature and provide feedback.
Microsoft Excel's UI automation implementation is ever changing, and  versions of Microsoft Office older than 16.0.13522.10000 may not expose enough information for this option to be of any use.
</P>
<A NAME="AdvancedSettingsWinConsoleSpeakPasswords"></A>
<H5>Speak passwords in all enhanced terminals</H5>
<P>
This setting controls whether characters are spoken by <A HREF="#KeyboardSettingsSpeakTypedCharacters">speak typed characters</A> or <A HREF="#KeyboardSettingsSpeakTypedWords">speak typed words</A> in situations where the screen does not update (such as password entry) in some terminal programs, such as the Windows Console with UI automation support enabled and Mintty.
For security purposes, this setting should be left disabled.
However, you may wish to enable it if you experience performance issues or instability with typed character and/or word reporting in consoles, or work in trusted environments and prefer password announcement.
</P>
<A NAME="AdvancedSettingsKeyboardSupportInLegacy"></A>
<H5>Use enhanced typed character support in legacy Windows Console when available</H5>
<P>
This option enables an alternative method for detecting typed characters in legacy Windows consoles.
While it improves performance and prevents some console output from being spelled out, it may be incompatible with some terminal programs.
This feature is available and enabled by default on Windows 10 versions 1607 and later when UI Automation is unavailable or disabled.
Warning: with this option enabled, typed characters that do not appear onscreen, such as passwords, will not be suppressed.
In untrusted environments, you may temporarily disable <A HREF="#KeyboardSettingsSpeakTypedCharacters">speak typed characters</A> and <A HREF="#KeyboardSettingsSpeakTypedWords">speak typed words</A> when entering passwords.
</P>
<A NAME="DiffAlgo"></A>
<H5>Diff algorithm</H5>
<P>
This setting controls how NVDA determines the new text to speak in terminals.
The diff algorithm combo box has three options:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Automatic: This option causes NVDA to prefer Diff Match Patch in most situations, but fall back to Difflib in problematic applications, such as older versions of the Windows Console and Mintty.
<LI>Diff Match Patch: This option causes NVDA to calculate changes to terminal text by character, even in situations where it is not recommended.
It may improve performance when large volumes of text are written to the console and allow more accurate reporting of changes made in the middle of lines.
However, in some applications, reading of new text may be choppy or inconsistent.
<LI>Difflib: this option causes NVDA to calculate changes to terminal text by line, even in situations where it is not recommended.
It is identical to NVDA's behaviour in versions 2020.4 and earlier.
This setting may stabilize reading of incoming text in some applications.
However, in terminals, when inserting or deleting a character in the middle of a line, the text after the caret will be read out.
</UL>

<DL>
<DT>Default</DT><DD>
  Diffing
<DT>Options</DT><DD>
  Diffing, UIA notifications
</DL>

<P></P>
<P>
This option selects how NVDA determines what text is "new" (and thus what to speak when "report dynamic content changes" is enabled) in Windows Terminal and the WPF Windows Terminal control used in Visual Studio 2022.
It does not affect the Windows Console (<CODE>conhost.exe</CODE>).
The Speak new text in Windows Terminal combo box has three options:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Default: This option is currently equivalent to "diffing", but it is anticipated to change once support for UIA notifications is further developed.
<LI>Diffing: This option uses the selected diff algorithm to calculate changes each time the terminal renders new text.
This is identical to NVDA's behaviour in versions 2022.4 and earlier.
<LI>UIA notifications: This option defers the responsibility of determining what text to speak to Windows Terminal itself, meanning that NVDA no longer has to determine what text currently on-screen is "new".
This should markedly improve performance and stability of Windows Terminal, but this feature is not yet complete.
In particular, typed characters that are not displayed on-screen, such as passwords, are reported when this option is selected.
Additionally, contiguous spans of output of over 1,000 characters may not be reported accurately.
</UL>

<P></P>
<A NAME="CancelExpiredFocusSpeech"></A>
<H5>Attempt to cancel speech for expired focus events</H5>
<P>
This option enables behaviour which attempts to cancel speech for expired focus events.
In particular moving quickly through messages in Gmail with Chrome can cause NVDA to speak outdated information.
This functionality is enabled by default as of NVDA 2021.1.
</P>
<A NAME="AdvancedSettingsCaretMoveTimeout"></A>
<H5>Caret move timeout (in MS)</H5>
<P>
This option allows you to configure the number of milliseconds NVDA will wait for the caret (insertion point) to move in editable text controls.
If you find that NVDA seems to be incorrectly tracking the caret E.g. it seems to be always one character behind or is repeating lines, then you may wish to try increasing this value.
</P>
<A NAME="ReportTransparentColors"></A>
<H5>Report transparency for colors</H5>
<P>
This option enables reporting when colors are transparent, useful for addon/appModule developers gathering information to improve user experience with a 3rd party application.
Some GDI applications will highlight text with a background color, NVDA (via display model) attempts to report this color.
In some situations, the text background may be entirely transparent, with the text layered on some other GUI element.
With several historically popular GUI APIs, the text may be rendered with a transparent background, but visually the background color is accurate.
</P>
<A NAME="AdvancedSettingsDebugLoggingCategories"></A>
<H5>Debug logging categories</H5>
<P>
The checkboxes in this list allow you to enable specific categories of debug messages in NVDA's log.
Logging these messages can result in decreased performance and large log files.
Only turn one of these on if specifically instructed to by an NVDA developer e.g. when debugging why a braille display driver is not functioning correctly.
</P>
<A NAME="PlayErrorSound"></A>
<H5>Play a sound for logged errors</H5>
<P>
This option allows you to specify if NVDA will play an error sound in case an error is logged.
Choosing Only in test versions (default) makes NVDA play error sounds only if the current NVDA version is a test version (alpha, beta or run from source).
Choosing Yes allows to enable error sounds whatever your current NVDA version is.
</P>
<A NAME="MiscSettings"></A>
<H3>12.2. miscellaneous Settings</H3>
<P>
Besides the <A HREF="#NVDASettings">NVDA Settings</A> dialog, The Preferences sub-menu of the NVDA Menu contains several other items which are outlined below.
</P>
<A NAME="SpeechDictionaries"></A>
<H4>12.2.1. Speech dictionaries</H4>
<P>
The speech dictionaries menu (found in the Preferences menu) contains dialogs that allow you to manage the way NVDA pronounces particular words or phrases.
There are currently three different types of speech dictionaries.
They are:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Default: rules in this dictionary affect all speech in NVDA.
<LI>Voice: rules in this dictionary affect speech for the synthesizer voice currently being used.
<LI>Temporary: rules in this dictionary affect all speech in NVDA, but only for the current session. These rules are temporary and will be lost if NVDA is restarted.
</UL>

<P></P>
<P>
You need to assign custom gestures using the <A HREF="#InputGestures">Input Gestures dialog</A> if you wish to open any of these dictionary dialogs from anywhere.
</P>
<P>
All dictionary dialogs contain a list of rules which will be used for processing the speech.
The dialog also contains Add, Edit, Remove and Remove all buttons.
</P>
<P>
To add a new rule to the dictionary, press the Add button, and fill in the fields in the dialog box that appears and then press Ok.
You will then see your new rule in the list of rules.
However, to make sure your rule is actually saved, make sure to press Ok to exit the dictionary dialog completely once you have finished adding/editing rules.
</P>
<P>
The rules for NVDA's speech dictionaries allow you to change one string of characters into another.
For example, you could create a rule which causes NVDA to say the word "frog" instead of "bird" whenever the word "bird" is encountered.
In the Add rule dialog, the easiest way to do this is to type the word bird in the Pattern field, and the word frog in the Replacement field.
You may also want to type a description of the rule in the Comment field (something like: changes bird to frog).
</P>
<P>
NVDA's speech dictionaries however are much more powerful than simple word replacement.
The Add rule dialog also contains a checkbox to say whether or not you want the rule to be case sensitive (meaning that NVDA should care whether the characters are uppercase or lowercase.
NVDA ignores case by default).
</P>
<P>
Finally, a set of radio buttons allows you to tell NVDA whether your pattern should match anywhere, should only match if it is a complete word or should be treated as a "Regular expression".
Setting the pattern to match as a whole word means that the replacement will only be made if the pattern does not occur as part of a larger word.
This condition is met if the characters immediately before and after the word are anything other than a letter, a number, or an underscore, or if there are no characters at all.
Thus, using the earlier example of replacing the word "bird" with "frog", if you were to make this a whole word replacement, it would not match "birds" or "bluebird".
</P>
<P>
A regular expression is a pattern containing special symbols that allow you to match on more than one character at a time, or match on just numbers, or just letters, as a few examples.
Regular expressions are not covered in this user guide.
For an introductory tutorial, please refer to [<A HREF="https://docs.python.org/3.7/howto/regex.html">https://docs.python.org/3.7/howto/regex.html</A>].
</P>
<A NAME="SymbolPronunciation"></A>
<H4>12.2.2. Punctuation/symbol pronunciation</H4>
<P>
This dialog allows you to change the way punctuation and other symbols are pronounced, as well as the symbol level at which they are spoken.
</P>
<P>
The language for which symbol pronunciation is being edited will be shown in the dialog's title.
Note that this dialog respects the "Trust voice's language for processing symbols and characters" option found in the <A HREF="#SpeechSettings">Speech category</A> of the <A HREF="#NVDASettings">NVDA Settings</A> dialog; i.e. it uses the voice language rather than the NVDA global language setting when this option is enabled.
</P>
<P>
To change a symbol, first select it in the Symbols list.
You can filter the symbols by entering the symbol or a part of the symbol's replacement into the Filter by edit box.
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The Replacement field allows you to change the text that should be spoken in place of this symbol.
<LI>Using the Level field, you can adjust the lowest symbol level at which this symbol should be spoken.
<LI>The Send actual symbol to synthesizer field specifies when the symbol itself (in contrast to its replacement) should be sent to the synthesizer.
This is useful if the symbol causes the synthesizer to pause or change the inflection of the voice.
For example, a comma causes the synthesizer to pause.
There are three options:
 <UL>
 <LI>never: Never send the actual symbol to the synthesizer.
 <LI>always: Always send the actual symbol to the synthesizer.
 <LI>only below symbols' level: Send the actual symbol only if the configured speech symbol level is lower than the level set for this symbol.
 For example, you might use this so that a symbol will have its replacement spoken at higher levels without pausing, while still being indicated with a pause at lower levels.
 </UL>
</UL>

<P></P>
<P>
You can add new symbols by pressing the Add button.
In the dialog that appears, enter the symbol and press the OK button.
Then, change the fields for the new symbol as you would for other symbols.
</P>
<P>
You can remove a symbol you previously added by pressing the Remove button.
</P>
<P>
When you are finished, press the OK button to save your changes or the Cancel button to discard them.
</P>

<A NAME="InputGestures"></A>
<H4>12.2.3. Input Gestures</H4>
<P>
In this dialog, you can customize the input gestures (keys on the keyboard, buttons on a braille display, etc.) for NVDA commands.
</P>
<P>
Only commands that are applicable immediately before the dialog is opened are shown.
For example, if you want to customize commands related to browse mode, you should open the Input Gestures dialog while you are in browse mode.
</P>
<P>
The tree in this dialog lists all of the applicable NVDA commands grouped by category.
You can filter them by entering one or more words from the command's name into the Filter by edit box in any order.
Any gestures associated with a command are listed beneath the command.
</P>
<P>
To add an input gesture to a command, select the command and press the Add button.
Then, perform the input gesture you wish to associate; e.g. press a key on the keyboard or a button on a braille display.
Often, a gesture can be interpreted in more than one way.
For example, if you pressed a key on the keyboard, you may wish it to be specific to the current keyboard layout (e.g. desktop or laptop) or you may wish it to apply for all layouts.
In this case, a menu will appear allowing you to select the desired option.
</P>
<P>
To remove a gesture from a command, select the gesture and press the Remove button.
</P>
<P>
The Emulated system keyboard keys category contains NVDA commands that emulate keys on the system keyboard.
These emulated system keyboard keys can be used to control a system keyboard right from your braille display.
To add an emulated input gesture, select the Emulated system keyboard keys category and press the Add button.
Then, press the key on the keyboard you wish to emulate.
After that, the key will be available from the Emulated system keyboard keys category and you will be able to assign an input gesture to it as described above.
</P>
<P>
Note:
</P>
 <UL>
 <LI>Emulated keys must have gestures assigned in order to persist when saving / closing the dialog.
 <LI>An input gesture with modifier keys may not be able to be mapped to an emulated gesture without modifier
 keys. For instance, setting the emulated input 'a' and configuring an input gesture of 'ctrl+m', may result
 in the application receiving 'ctrl+a'.

<A NAME="ConfigurationProfiles"></A>
<H3>12.4. Configuration Profiles</H3>
<P>
Sometimes, you may wish to have different settings for different situations.
For example, you may wish to have reporting of indentation enabled while you are editing or reporting of font attributes enabled while you are proofreading.
NVDA allows you to do this using configuration profiles.
</P>
<P>
A configuration profile contains only those settings which are changed while the profile is being edited.
Most settings can be changed in configuration profiles except for those in the General category of the <A HREF="#NVDASettings">NVDA Settings</A> dialog, which apply to the entirety of NVDA.
</P>
<P>
Configuration profiles can be manually activated either from a dialog or using custom added gestures.
They can also be activated automatically due to triggers such as switching to a particular application.
</P>
<A NAME="ProfilesBasicManagement"></A>
<H4>12.4.1. Basic Management</H4>
<P>
You manage configuration profiles by selecting "Configuration profiles" in the NVDA menu.
You can also do this using a key command:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>NVDA+control+p: Show the Configuration Profiles dialog.
</UL>

<P></P>
<P>
The first control in this dialog is the profile list from which you can select one of the available profiles.
When you open the dialog, the profile you are currently editing is selected.

In the New Profile dialog, you can enter a name for the profile.
You can also select how this profile should be used.
If you only want to use this profile manually, select Manual activation, which is the default.
Otherwise, select a trigger which should automatically activate this profile.
For convenience, if you haven't entered a name for the profile, selecting a trigger will fill in the name accordingly.
See <A HREF="#ConfigProfileTriggers">below</A> for more information about triggers.
</P>
<P>
Pressing OK will create the profile and close the Configuration Profiles dialog so you can edit it.
</P>
<A NAME="ConfigProfileManual"></A>
<H4>12.4.3. Manual Activation</H4>
<P>
You can manually activate a profile by selecting a profile and pressing the Manual activate button.
Once activated, other profiles can still be activated due to triggers, but any settings in the manually activated profile will override them.
For example, if a profile is triggered for the current application and reporting of links is enabled in that profile but disabled it in the manually activated profile, links will not be reported.
However, if you have changed the voice in the triggered profile but have never changed it in the manually activated profile, the voice from the triggered profile will be used.
Any settings you change will be saved in the manually activated profile.
To deactivate a manually activated profile, select it in the Configuration Profiles dialog and press the Manual deactivate button.
</P>
<A NAME="ConfigProfileTriggers"></A>
<H4>12.4.4. Triggers</H4>

<A NAME="ConfigProfileEditing"></A>
<H4>12.4.5. Editing a Profile</H4>
<P>
If you have manually activated a profile, any settings you change will be saved to that profile.
Otherwise, any settings you change will be saved to the most recently triggered profile.
For example, if you have associated a profile with the Notepad application and you switch to Notepad, any changed settings will be saved to that profile.
Finally, if there is neither a manually activated nor a triggered profile, any settings you change will be saved to your normal configuration.
</P>
<P>
To edit the profile associated with say all, you must <A HREF="#ConfigProfileManual">manually activate</A> that profile.
</P>
<A NAME="ConfigProfileDisablingTriggers"></A>
<H4>12.4.6. Temporarily Disabling Triggers</H4>
<P>
Sometimes, it is useful to temporarily disable all triggers.
For example, you might wish to edit a manually activated profile or your normal configuration without triggered profiles interfering.
You can do this by checking the Temporarily disable all triggers checkbox in the Configuration Profiles dialog.
</P>
<P>
To toggle disabling triggers from anywhere, please assign a custom gesture using the <A HREF="#InputGestures">Input Gestures dialog</A>.

<A NAME="ConfigProfileGestures"></A>
<H4>12.4.7. Activating a profile using input gestures</H4>
<P>
For every profile you add, you are able to assign one or more input gestures to activate it.
By default, configuration profiles do not have input gestures assigned.
You can add gestures to activate a profile using the <A HREF="#InputGestures">Input Gestures dialog</A>.
Every profile has its own entry under the configuration profiles category.
When you rename a profile, any gesture you added previously will still be available.
Removing a profile will automatically delete the gestures associated with it.
</P>
<A NAME="LocationOfConfigurationFiles"></A>
<H3>12.5. Location of Configuration files</H3>
<P>
Portable versions of NVDA store all settings and add-ons in a directory called userConfig, found in the NVDA directory.
</P>
<P>
Installed versions of NVDA store all settings and add-ons in a special NVDA directory located in your Windows user profile.
This means that each user on the system can have their own NVDA settings.
To open your settings directory from anywhere you can use <A HREF="#InputGestures">Input Gestures dialog</A> to add a custom gesture.
In addition for an installed version of NVDA, on the start menu you can go to programs -&gt; NVDA -&gt; explore user configuration directory.
</P>
<P>
Settings for NVDA when running during sign-in or on UAC screens are stored in the systemConfig directory in NVDA's installation directory.
Usually, this configuration should not be touched.
To change NVDA's configuration during sign-in or on UAC screens, configure NVDA as you wish while signed into Windows, save the configuration, and then press the "use currently saved settings during sign-in and on secure screens" button in the General category of the <A HREF="#NVDASettings">NVDA Settings</A> dialog.

<H3>13.2. Speech Viewer</H3>
<P>
For sighted software developers or people demoing NVDA to sighted audiences, a floating window is available that allows you to view all the text that NVDA is currently speaking.
</P>
<P>
To enable the speech viewer, check the "Speech Viewer" menu item under Tools in the NVDA menu.
Uncheck the menu item to disable it.
</P>
<P>
The speech viewer window contains a check box labelled "Show speech viewer on startup".
If this is checked, the speech viewer will open when NVDA is started.
The speech viewer window will always attempt to re-open with the same dimensions and location as when it was closed.
</P>
<P>
While the speech viewer is enabled, it constantly updates to show you the most current text being spoken.
However, if you click or focus inside the viewer, NVDA will temporarily stop updating the text, so that you are able to easily select or copy the existing content.
</P>
<P>
To toggle the speech viewer from anywhere, please assign a custom gesture using the <A HREF="#InputGestures">Input Gestures dialog</A>.

<A NAME="BrailleViewer"></A>
<H3>13.3. Braille Viewer</H3>
<P>
For sighted software developers or people demoing NVDA to sighted audiences, a floating window is available that allows you to view braille output, and the text equivalent for each braille character.
The braille viewer can be used at the same time as a physical braille display, it will match the number of cells on the physical device.
While the braille viewer is enabled, it constantly updates to show you the braille that would be displayed on a physical braille display.
</P>
<P>
To enable the braille viewer, check the "Braille Viewer" menu item under Tools in the NVDA menu.
Uncheck the menu item to disable it.
</P>
<P>
Physical braille displays typically have buttons to scroll forwards or backwards, to enable scrolling with the braille viewer tool use the <A HREF="#InputGestures">Input Gestures dialog</A> to assign keyboard shortcuts which "Scrolls the braille display back" and "Scrolls the braille display forward"
</P>
<P>
The braille viewer window contains a check box labelled "Show braille viewer on startup".
If this is checked, the braille viewer will open when NVDA is started.
The braille viewer window will always attempt to re-open with the same dimensions and location as when it was closed.
</P>
<P>
The braille viewer window contains a check box labeled "Hover for cell routing", the default is unchecked.
If checked, hovering the mouse over a braille cell will enable trigger the "route to braille cell" command for that cell.
This is often used to move the caret or trigger the action for a control.
This can be useful for testing NVDA is able to correctly reverse map a from braille cell.
To prevent unintentionally routing to cells, the command is delayed.
The mouse must hover until the cell turns green.
The cell will start as a light yellow colour, transition to orange, then suddenly become green.
</P>
<P>
To toggle the braille viewer from anywhere, please assign a custom gesture using the <A HREF="#InputGestures">Input Gestures dialog</A>.

<A NAME="AddonsManager"></A>
<H3>13.5. Add-ons Manager</H3>
<P>
The Add-ons Manager, accessed by selecting Manage add-ons under Tools in the NVDA menu, allows you to install, uninstall, enable and disable add-on packages for NVDA.
These packages are provided by the community and contain custom code that may add or change features in NVDA or even provide support for extra Braille displays or speech synthesizers.
</P>
<P>
The Add-ons Manager contains a list that displays all the add-ons currently installed in your NVDA user configuration. 
Package name, status, version and author are shown for each add-on, though further information such as a description and URL can be viewed by selecting the add-on and pressing the About add-on button.
If there is help available for the selected add-on, you can access it by pressing the Add-on help button.
</P>
<P>
To browse and download available add-ons online, press the Get add-ons button.
This button opens the <A HREF="https://addons.nvda-project.org/">NVDA Add-ons page</A>.
If NVDA is installed and running on your system, you can open the add-on directly from the browser to begin the installation process as described below.
Otherwise, save the add-on package and follow the instructions below.
</P>
<P>
To install an Add-on you previously obtained, press the Install button.
This will allow you to browse for an add-on package (.nvda-addon file) somewhere on your computer or on a network.
Once you press Open, the installation process will begin.
</P>
<P>
When an add-on is being installed, NVDA will first ask you to confirm that you really wish to install the add-on.
As the functionality of add-ons is unrestricted inside NVDA, which in theory could include accessing your personal data or even the entire system if NVDA is an installed copy, it is very important to only install add-ons from sources you trust.
Once the add-on is installed, NVDA must be restarted for the add-on to start running. 
Until you do, a status of "install" will show for that add-on in the list.
</P>
<P>
To remove an add-on, select the add-on from the list and press the Remove button.
NVDA will ask if you really wish to do this.
As with installing, NVDA must be restarted for the add-on to be fully  removed.
Until you do, a status of "remove" will be shown for that add-on in the list.
</P>
<P>
To disable an add-on, press the "disable" button.
To enable a previously disabled add-on, press the "enable" button.
You can disable an add-on if the add-on status indicates it is  "enabled", or enable it if the add-on is "disabled".
For each press of the enable/disable button, add-on status changes to indicate what will happen when NVDA restarts.
If the add-on was previously "disabled", a status will show "enabled after restart".
If the add-on was previously "enabled", a status will show "disabled after restart".
Just like when you install or remove add-ons, you need to restart NVDA in order for changes to take effect.
</P>
<P>
The manager also has a Close button to close the dialog.
If you have installed, removed or changed the status of an add-on, NVDA will first ask you if you wish to restart so that your changes can take effect.
</P>
<P>
Some older add-ons may no longer be compatible with the version of NVDA that you have.
When using an older version of NVDA, some new add-ons may not be compatible either.
Attempting to install an incompatible add-on will result in an error explaining why the add-on is considered incompatible.
To inspect these incompatible add-ons, you can use the "view incompatible add-ons" button to launch the incompatible add-ons manager.
</P>
<P>
To access the Add-ons Manager from anywhere, please assign a custom gesture using the <A HREF="#InputGestures">Input Gestures dialog</A>.

<H4>13.5.1. Incompatible Add-ons Manager</H4>
<P>
The Incompatible Add-ons Manager, which can be accessed via the "view incompatible add-ons" button in the Add-on manager, allows you to inspect any incompatible add-ons, and the reason they are considered incompatible.
Add-ons are considered incompatible when they have not been updated to work with significant changes to NVDA, or when they rely on a feature not available in the version of NVDA you are using.
The Incompatible add-ons manager has a short message to explain its purpose as well as the version of NVDA.
The incompatible add-ons are presented in a list with the following columns:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Package, the name of the add-on
<LI>Version, the version of the add-on
<LI>Incompatible reason, an explanation of why the add-on is considered incompatible
</OL>

The Incompatible add-ons manager also has an "About add-on..." button.
This dialog will provide you with the full details of the add-on, which is helpful when contacting the add-on author.
</P>
<A NAME="CreatePortableCopy"></A>
<H3>13.6. Create portable copy</H3>
<P>
This will open a dialog which allows you to create a portable copy of NVDA out of the installed version.
Either way, when running a portable copy of NVDA, in the extra tool sub menu the menu item will be called "install NVDA on this PC" instead of "create portable copy).
</P>
<P>
The dialog to create a portable copy of NVDA or to install NVDA on this PC will prompt you to choose a folder path in which NVDA should create the portable copy or in which NVDA should be installed.
</P>

<A NAME="RunCOMRegistrationFixingTool"></A>
<H3>13.7. Run COM registration fixing tool...</H3>
<P>
Installing and uninstalling programs on a computer can, in certain cases, cause COM DLL files to get unregistered.
As COM Interfaces such as IAccessible depend on correct COM DLL registrations, issues can appear in case the correct registration is missing.
</P>
<P>
This can happen i.e. after installing and uninstalling Adobe Reader, Math Player and other programs.
</P>
<P>
The missing registration can cause issues in browsers, desktop apps, task bar and other interfaces.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, following issues can be solved by running this tool:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>NVDA reports "unknown" when navigating in browsers such as Firefox, Thunderbird etc.
<LI>NVDA fails to switch between focus mode and browse mode
<LI>NVDA is very slow when navigating in browsers while using browse mode

<H3>14.1. eSpeak NG</H3>
<P>
The <A HREF="https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng">eSpeak NG</A> synthesizer is built directly into NVDA and does not require any other special drivers or components to be installed.
On Windows 7, 8 and 8.1, NVDA uses eSpeak NG by default (<A HREF="#OneCore">Windows OneCore</A> is used in Windows 10 and later by default).
As this synthesizer is built into NVDA, this is a great choice for when running NVDA off a USB thumb drive on other systems.
</P>
<P>
Each voice that comes with eSpeak NG speaks a different language.
There are over 43 different languages supported by eSpeak NG.
</P>
<P>
There are also many variants which can be chosen to alter the sound of the voice.
</P>
<A NAME="SAPI4"></A>
<H3>14.2. Microsoft Speech API version 4 (SAPI 4)</H3>
<P>
SAPI 4 is an older Microsoft standard for software speech synthesizers.
NVDA still supports this for users who already have SAPI 4 synthesizers installed.
However, Microsoft no longer support this and needed components are no longer available from Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
When using this synthesizer with NVDA, the available voices (accessed from the <A HREF="#SpeechSettings">Speech category</A> of the <A HREF="#NVDASettings">NVDA Settings</A> dialog or by the <A HREF="#SynthSettingsRing">Synth Settings Ring</A>) will contain all the voices from all the installed SAPI 4 engines found on your system.
</P>
<A NAME="SAPI5"></A>
<H3>14.3. Microsoft Speech API version 5 (SAPI 5)</H3>
<P>
SAPI 5 is a Microsoft standard for software speech synthesizers.
Many speech synthesizers that comply with this standard may be purchased or downloaded for free from various companies and websites, though your system will probably already come with at least one SAPI 5 voice preinstalled.
When using this synthesizer with NVDA, the available voices (accessed from the <A HREF="#SpeechSettings">Speech category</A> of the <A HREF="#NVDASettings">NVDA Settings</A> dialog or by the <A HREF="#SynthSettingsRing">Synth Settings Ring</A>) will contain all the voices from all the installed SAPI 5 engines found on your system.

<A NAME="MicrosoftSpeechPlatform"></A>
<H3>14.4. Microsoft Speech Platform</H3>
<P>
The Microsoft Speech Platform provides voices for many languages which are normally used in the development of server-based speech applications.
These voices can also be used with NVDA.
</P>
<P>
To use these voices, you will need to install two components:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Microsoft Speech Platform - Runtime (Version 11) , x86: <A HREF="https://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=27225">https://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=27225</A>

 For example, the file MSSpeech_TTS_en-US_ZiraPro.msi is a U.S. English voice.
 </UL>
</UL>

<P></P>
<A NAME="OneCore"></A>
<H3>14.5. Windows OneCore Voices</H3>
<P>
Windows 10 and later includes voices known as "OneCore" or "mobile" voices.
Voices are provided for many languages, and they are more responsive than the Microsoft voices available using Microsoft Speech API version 5.
On Windows 10 and later, NVDA uses Windows OneCore voices by default (<A HREF="#eSpeakNG">eSpeak NG</A> is used in other releases).
</P>
<P>
To add new Windows OneCore voices, go to "Speech Settings", within Windows system settings. 
Use the "Add voices" option and search for the desired language.
Many languages include multiple variants.
"United Kingdom" and "Australia" are two of the English variants.
"France", "Canada" and "Switzerland" are French variants available.
Search for the broader language (such as English or French), then locate the variant in the list.
Select any languages desired and use the "add" button to add them.
Once added, restart NVDA.

All Focus and PAC Mate displays from <A HREF="https://www.freedomscientific.com/">Freedom Scientific</A> are supported when connected via USB or bluetooth.
You will need the Freedom Scientific braille display drivers installed on your system.
If you do not have them already, you can obtain them from <A HREF="https://support.freedomscientific.com/Downloads/Focus/FocusBlueBrailleDisplayDriver">https://support.freedomscientific.com/Downloads/Focus/FocusBlueBrailleDisplayDriver</A>.
Although this page only mentions the Focus Blue display, the drivers support all Freedom Scientific Focus and Pacmate displays.
</P>
<P>
By default, NVDA can automatically detect and connect to these displays either via USB or bluetooth.
However, when configuring the display, you can explicitly select "USB" or "Bluetooth" ports to restrict the connection type to be used.
This might be useful if you want to connect the focus display to NVDA using bluetooth, but still be able to charge it using USB power from your computer.
NVDA's automatic braille display detection will also recognize the display on USB or Bluetooth.
</P>

Following are the key assignments for this display with NVDA.

<H3>15.3. Optelec ALVA 6 series/protocol converter</H3>
<P>
Both the ALVA BC640 and BC680 displays from <A HREF="https://www.optelec.com/">Optelec</A> are supported when connected via USB or bluetooth.
Alternatively, you can connect an older Optelec display, such as a Braille Voyager, using a protocol converter supplied by Optelec.
You do not need any specific drivers to be installed to use these displays.
Just plug in the display and configure NVDA to use it.
</P>
<P>
Note: NVDA might be unable to use an ALVA BC6 display over Bluetooth when it is paired using the ALVA Bluetooth utility.
When you have paired your device using this utility and NVDA is unable to detect your device, we recommend you to pair your ALVA display the regular way using the Windows Bluetooth settings.
</P>
<P>
Note: while some of these displays do have a braille keyboard, they handle translation from braille to text themselves by default.
This means that NVDA's braille input system is not in use in the default situation (i.e. the input braille table setting has no effect).
For ALVA displays with recent firmware, it is possible to disable this HID keyboard simulation using an input gesture.

Most devices have an Easy Access Bar (EAB) that allows intuitive and fast operation.
The EAB can be moved in four directions where generally each direction has two switches.
The C and Live series are the only exceptions to this rule.
</P>
<P>
The c-series and some other displays have two routing rows whereby the upper row is used to report formatting information.
Holding one of the upper routing keys and pressing the EAB on c-series devices emulates the second switch state.
The live series displays have one routing row only and the EAB has one step per direction.
The second step may be emulated by pressing one of the routing keys and pressing the EAB in the corresponding direction.
Pressing and holding the up, down, right and left keys (or EAB) causes the corresponding action to be repeated.

<H3>15.14. HumanWare BrailleNote</H3>
<P>
NVDA supports the BrailleNote notetakers from <A HREF="https://www.humanware.com">Humanware</A> when acting as a display terminal for a screen reader.
The following models are supported:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>BrailleNote Classic (serial connection only)
<LI>BrailleNote PK (Serial and bluetooth connections)
<LI>BrailleNote MPower (Serial and bluetooth connections)
<LI>BrailleNote Apex (USB and Bluetooth connections)
</UL>

<P></P>
<P>
For BrailleNote Touch, please refer to  the <A HREF="#HumanWareBrailliant">Brailliant BI Series / BrailleNote Touch</A> section.
</P>
<P>
Except for BrailleNote PK, both braille (BT) and QWERTY (QT) keyboards are supported.
For BrailleNote QT, PC keyboard emulation isn't supported.
You can also enter braille dots using the QT keyboard.
Please check the braille terminal section of the BrailleNote manual guide for details.
</P>
<P>
If your device supports more than one type of connection, when connecting your BrailleNote to NVDA, you must set the braille terminal port in braille terminal options.
Please check the BrailleNote manual for details.
In NVDA, you may also need to set the port in the <A HREF="#SelectBrailleDisplay">Select Braille Display</A> dialog.
If you are connecting via USB or bluetooth, you can set the port to "Automatic", "USB" or "Bluetooth", depending on the available choices.
If connecting using a legacy serial port (or a USB to serial converter) or if none of the previous options appear, you must explicitly choose the communication port to be used from the list of hardware ports.
</P>
<P>
Before connecting your BrailleNote Apex using its USB client interface, you must install the drivers provided by HumanWare.
</P>
<P>
On the BrailleNote Apex BT, you can use the scroll wheel located between dots 1 and 4 for various NVDA commands.
The wheel consists of four directional dots, a centre click button, and a wheel that spins clockwise or counterclockwise.
</P>
<P>
Following are the BrailleNote command assignments for NVDA.
Please check your BrailleNote's documentation to find where these keys are located.

<P>
The SuperBraille device, mostly available in Taiwan, can be connected to by either USB or serial.
As the SuperBraille does not have any physical typing keys or scrolling buttons, all input must be performed via a standard computer keyboard.
Due to this, and to maintain compatibility with other screen readers in Taiwan, two key bindings for scrolling the braille display have been provided:

<P>
The Esys, Esytime and Iris displays from <A HREF="https://www.eurobraille.fr/">Eurobraille</A> are supported by NVDA.
Esys and Esytime-Evo devices are supported when connected via USB or bluetooth.
Older Esytime devices only support USB.
Iris displays can only be connected via a serial port.
Therefore, for these displays, you should select the port to which the display is connected after you have chosen this driver in the Braille Settings dialog.
</P>
<P>
Iris and Esys displays have a braille keyboard with 10 keys.
Of the two keys placed like a space bar, the left key is corresponding to the backspace key and the right key to the space key.

<H3>15.18. Nattiq nBraille Displays</H3>
<P>
NVDA supports displays from <A HREF="https://www.nattiq.com/">Nattiq Technologies</A> when connected via USB.
Windows 10 and later detects the Braille Displays once connected, you may need to install USB drivers if using older versions of Windows (below Win10).
You can get them from the manufacturer's website.

<H3>15.19. BRLTTY</H3>
<P>
<A HREF="https://www.brltty.com/">BRLTTY</A> is a separate program which can be used to support many more braille displays.
In order to use this, you need to install <A HREF="https://www.brltty.com/download.html">BRLTTY for Windows</A>.
You should download and install the latest installer package, which will be named, for example, brltty-win-4.2-2.exe.
When configuring the display and port to use, be sure to pay close attention to the instructions, especially if you are using a USB display and already have the manufacturer's drivers installed.
</P>
<P>
For displays which have a braille keyboard, BRLTTY currently handles braille input itself.
Therefore, NVDA's braille input table setting is not relevant.
</P>
<P>
BRLTTY is not involved in NVDA's automatic background braille display detection functionality.
</P>
<P>
Following are the BRLTTY command assignments for NVDA.
Please see the <A HREF="http://mielke.cc/brltty/doc/KeyBindings/">BRLTTY key binding lists</A> for information about how BRLTTY commands are mapped to controls on braille displays.

<H3>15.20. Tivomatic Caiku Albatross 46/80</H3>
<P>
The Caiku Albatross devices, which were manufactured by Tivomatic and available in Finland, can be connected to by either USB or serial.
You do not need any specific drivers to be installed to use these displays.
Just plug in the display and configure NVDA to use it.
</P>
<P>
Note: Baud rate 19200 is strongly recommended.
If required, switch Baud rate setting value to 19200 from the braille device's menu.
Although the driver supports 9600 baud rate, it has no way to control what baud rate the display uses.
Because 19200 is the display default baud rate, the driver tries it at first.
If baud rates are not the same, the driver may behave unexpectedly.

<H3>15.21. Standard HID Braille displays</H3>
<P>
This is an experimental driver for the new Standard HID Braille Specification, agreed upon in 2018 by Microsoft, Google, Apple and several assistive technology companies including NV Access. 
The hope is that all future Braille Display models created by any manufacturer, will use this standard protocol which will remove the need for manufacturer-specific Braille drivers.
</P>
<P>
NVDA's automatic braille display detection will also recognize any display that supports this protocol.

<A NAME="CommandLineOptions"></A>
<H3>16.3. Command Line Options</H3>
<P>
NVDA can accept one or more additional options when it starts which alter its behaviour.
You can pass as many options as you need.
These options can be passed when starting from a shortcut (in the shortcut properties), from the Run dialog (Start Menu -&gt; Run or Windows+r) or from a Windows command console.
Options should be separated from the name of NVDA's executable file and from other options by spaces.
For example, a useful option is --disable-addons, which tells NVDA to suspend all running add-ons.
This allows you to determine whether a problem is caused by an add-on and to recover from serious problems caused by add-ons.
</P>
<P>
As an example, you can exit the currently running copy of NVDA by entering the following in the Run dialog:
</P>
<P>
nvda -q
</P>
<P>
Some of the command line options have a short and a long version, while some of them have only a long version.
For those which have a short version, you can combine them like this:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="4">
<TR>
<TD>nvda -mc CONFIGPATH</TD>
<TD>This will start NVDA with startup sounds and message disabled, and the specified configuration</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>nvda -mc CONFIGPATH --disable-addons</TD>
<TD>Same as above, but with add-ons disabled</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Some of the command line options accept additional parameters; e.g. how detailed the logging should be or the path to the user configuration directory.
Those parameters should be placed after the option, separated from the option by a space when using the short version or an equals sign (=) when using the long version; e.g.:
