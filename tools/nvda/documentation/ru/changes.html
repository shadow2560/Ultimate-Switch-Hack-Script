<P>
В этом выпуске представлена поддержка новой спецификации USB HID Braille.
Целью данной спецификации является стандартизация поддержки брайлевских дисплеев без необходимости использования отдельных драйверов.
Обновлён синтезатор речи eSpeak-NG и брайлевский транслятор LibLouis, включающий помимо прочего новые таблицы для русского сокращённого брайля и языка чивенда.
Звуки происходящих ошибок теперь можно включить в стабильных версиях NVDA с помощью новой опции в дополнительных настройках.
Режим «читать всё» в Microsoft Word теперь автоматически прокручивает читаемый документ для того, чтобы текущая позиция каретки всегда оставалась видимой на экране.
Сделано множество улучшений при использовании Microsoft Office через UI Automation.
Одно из них заключается в том, что NVDA теперь игнорирует большее количество макетных таблиц при чтении сообщений в Outlook.
</P>
<P>
Важное примечание:
</P>
<P>
Из-за обновления нашего сертификата безопасности, некоторые пользователи получают сообщение об ошибке при попытке NVDA 2021.2 проверить наличие обновлений.
NVDA теперь запрашивает у Windows обновление сертификатов безопасности, что предотвратит появление этой ошибки в будущем.
Пользователям, которые всё же столкнулись с данной проблемой, необходимо загрузить этот выпуск NVDA вручную.

В этом выпуске представлена предварительная поддержка Windows 11.
Хотя Windows 11 ещё не выпущена, этот выпуск был протестирован на её предварительных версиях.
Он также включает важное исправление для функции затемнения экрана (см. Важное примечание).
Средство восстановления COM-объектов теперь может решать больше проблем при запуске NVDA.
Есть обновления синтезатора eSpeak и брайлевского транслятора LibLouis.
Также есть различные исправления ошибок и улучшения, в частности, для поддержки брайля и терминальных программ Windows, калькулятора, панели эмодзи и истории буфера обмена.
</P>
<H3>Важное примечание</H3>
<P>
Из-за изменений в Windows Magnification API, функцию затемнения экрана пришлось обновить для поддержки новейших версий Windows.
Используйте NVDA 2021.2 для активации функции затемнения экрана в Windows 10 21H2 (10.0.19044) или более поздних версиях.
Сюда входят участники программы предварительной оценки Windows 10 и Windows 11.
В целях безопасности при использовании новой версии Windows, получите визуальное подтверждение того, что затемнение экрана делает экран полностью чёрным.

<LI>Microsoft Word documents are correctly treated as multi-line. This causes braille to behave more appropriately when a document is focused.
<LI>In Microsoft Internet Explorer, errors no longer occur when focusing on certain rare controls. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/2121" target="_blank">#2121</A>)
<LI>Changing the pronunciation of punctuation/symbols by the user will now take effect straight away, rather than requiring NVDA to be restarted or auto language switching to be disabled.
<LI>When using eSpeak, speech no longer goes silent in some cases in the Save As dialog of the NVDA Log Viewer. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/2145" target="_blank">#2145</A>)
</UL>

<H3>Changes for Developers</H3>
<UL>
<LI>There is now a remote Python console for situations where remote debugging is useful. See the Developer Guide for details.
<LI>The base path of NVDA's code is now stripped from tracebacks in the log to improve readability. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1880" target="_blank">#1880</A>)
<LI>TextInfo objects now have an activate() method to activate the position represented by the TextInfo.
 <UL>
 <LI>This is used by braille to activate the position using cursor routing keys on a braille display. However, there may be other callers in future.
 </UL>
<LI>TreeInterceptors and NVDAObjects which only expose one page of text at a time can support automatic page turns during say all by using the textInfos.DocumentWithPageTurns mix-in. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1978" target="_blank">#1978</A>)
<LI>Several control and output constants have been renamed or moved. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/228" target="_blank">#228</A>)
 <UL>
 <LI>speech.REASON_* constants have been moved to controlTypes.
 <LI>In controlTypes, speechRoleLabels and speechStateLabels have been renamed to just roleLabels and stateLabels, respectively.
 </UL>
<LI>Braille output is now logged at level input/output. First, the untranslated text of all regions is logged, followed by the braille cells of the window being displayed. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/2102" target="_blank">#2102</A>)
<LI>subclasses of the sapi5 synthDriver can now override _getVoiceTokens and extend <U>init</U> to support custom voice tokens such as with sapi.spObjectTokenCategory to get tokens from a custom registry location.
</UL>

<H2>2011.3</H2>
<P>
Highlights of this release include automatic speech language switching when reading documents with appropriate language information; support for 64 bit Java Runtime Environments; reporting of text formatting in browse mode in Mozilla applications; better handling of application crashes and freezes; and initial fixes for Windows 8.
</P>
<H3>New Features</H3>

<LI>When trying to read the status bar (Desktop NVDA+end), If a real status bar object cannot be located, NVDA will instead resort to using the bottom line of text written to the display for the active application. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/649" target="_blank">#649</A>)
<LI>When reading with say all in browse mode documents, NVDA will now pause at the end of headings and other block-level elements, rather than speaking the text together with the next lot of text as one long sentence.
<LI>In browse mode, pressing enter or space on a tab now activates it instead of switching to focus mode. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1760" target="_blank">#1760</A>)

<LI>NVDA now recovers from many more situations such as applications that stop responding which previously caused it to freeze completely. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1408" target="_blank">#1408</A>)
<LI>For Mozilla Gecko (Firefox etc) browse mode documents NVDA will no longer fail to render text in a very specific situation where an element is styled as display:table. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1373" target="_blank">#1373</A>)
<LI>NVDA will no longer announce label controls when focus moves inside of them. Stops double announcements of labels for some form fields in Firefox (Gecko) and Internet Explorer (MSHTML). (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1650" target="_blank">#1650</A>)
<LI>NVDA no longer fails to read a cell in Microsoft Excel after pasting in to it with control+v. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1781" target="_blank">#1781</A>)

<LI>NVDA will no longer crash apps such as winver and wordpad in Windows 8 developer preview due to bad glyph translations.
<LI>In browse mode in applications using Mozilla Gecko 10 and later (e.g. Firefox 10), the cursor is more often positioned correctly when loading a page with a target anchor. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/360" target="_blank">#360</A>)
<LI>In browse mode in Mozilla Gecko applications (e.g. Firefox), labels for image maps are now rendered.
<LI>With mouse tracking enabled, moving the mouse over certain editable text fields (such as in Synaptics Pointing Device Settings and SpeechLab SpeakText) no longer causes the application to crash. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/672" target="_blank">#672</A>)
<LI>NVDA now functions correctly in several about dialogs in applications distributed with Windows XP, including the About dialog in Notepad and the About Windows dialog.

</UL>

<H3>Changes for Developers</H3>
<UL>
<LI>NVDA can now instruct speech synthesizers to switch languages for particular sections of speech.
 <UL>
 <LI>To support this, drivers must handle speech.LangChangeCommand in sequences past to SynthDriver.speak().
 <LI>SynthDriver objects should also provide the language argument to VoiceInfo objects (or override the language attribute to retrieve the current language). Otherwise, NVDA's user interface language will be used.

<H2>2011.2</H2>
<P>
Список самых заметных новшеств в NVDA2011.2 включает в себя серьезные улучшения в обработке знаков пунктуации и символов, включая настраиваемые уровни произношения пунктуации, возможность изменять названия знаков пунктуации пользователем, фонетические описания символов. А также чтение без пауз в конце строки в режиме непрерывного чтения, улучшения в поддержке ARIA в браузере Internet Explorer, лучшую поддержку PDF-документов XFA/LiveCycle, перехват текста, выводящегося на экран в большем количестве приложений, доступ к информации о форматировании и цвете текста, выводящегося непосредственно на экран. 
</P>
<H3>Новое</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Теперь возможно услышать фонетическое описание для любого символа, нажав "просмотреть текущий символ" дважды быстро. Для латинских символов  используется стандартный английский фонетический алфавит. Для языков с иероглифическим письмом, таких как традиционный китайский, для символа обеспечивается одна или больше фраз-примеров. Также, нажав "просмотреть текущее слово" или "просмотреть текущую строку" трижды, можно услышать посимвольное чтение слова/строки с использованием фонетического описания. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/55" target="_blank">#55</A>)
<LI>В режиме плоского просмотра можно увидеть больше текста для приложений типа Mozilla Thunderbird, которые выводят свой текст непосредственно на экран в виде глифов. 
<LI>Теперь возможно выбирать между несколькими уровнями произношения знаков пунктуации и других символов. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/332" target="_blank">#332</A>)
<LI>Когда пунктуационный или любой другой символ повторяется четыре или больше раз, количество повторений произносится вместо повторяющихся символов. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/43" target="_blank">#43</A>)
<LI>Новые брайлевские таблицы: Norwegian 8 dot computer braille, Ethiopic grade 1, Slovene grade 1, Serbian grade 1. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1456" target="_blank">#1456</A>)
<LI>В речи больше нет неестественных пауз в конце каждой строки, когда используется команда "читать все". (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/149" target="_blank">#149</A>)
<LI>NVDA теперь будет объявлять, когда что-то отсортировано в браузерах (в соответствии со свойствами aria-sort). (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1500" target="_blank">#1500</A>)
<LI>Юникодные символы Брайля теперь будут корректно отображаться на брайлевских дисплеях. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1505" target="_blank">#1505</A>)
<LI>В Internet Explorer и других MSHTML элементах, когда фокус попадает в группу элементов (набор полей), NVDA теперь будет говорить имя группы (короткое описание). (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/535" target="_blank">#535</A>)
<LI>В Internet Explorer и других MSHTML элементах теперь учитываются свойства aria-labelledBy и aria-describedBy.
<LI>В Internet Explorer и других MSHTML элементах улучшена поддержка ARIA списка, ячейки таблицы, ползунка и индикатора выполнения.
<LI>Пользователи теперь могут изменять произношение знаков пунктуации и других символов также, как и принадлежность символа к какому-либо уровню. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/271" target="_blank">#271</A>, <A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1516" target="_blank">#1516</A>)
<LI>В Microsoft Excel теперь сообщается имя активного листа, когда переключение между листами происходит по control+pageUp или control+pageDown. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/760" target="_blank">#760</A>)
<LI>Во время перемещения по таблице в Microsoft Word с помощью клавиши tab NVDA будет объявлять текущую ячейку. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/159" target="_blank">#159</A>)
<LI>Теперь вы можете настроить чтение координат ячейки таблицы в диалоге "Форматирование документа". (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/719" target="_blank">#719</A>)
<LI>NVDA теперь может узнавать форматирование и цвет текста написанного на экране.
<LI>В списке сообщений Outlook Express/Windows Mail/Windows Live Mail  NVDA будет сообщать о том, что сообщение не прочитано, а также свернуто оно или развернуто, если у вас включены цепочки сообщений. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/868" target="_blank">#868</A>)
<LI>У eSpeak теперь есть настройка экстраускорения, которая утраивает скорость речи.
<LI>Добавлена поддержка элемента календаря, находящегося в диалоге даты и времени, доступного из часов Windows 7. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1637" target="_blank">#1637</A>) 
<LI>Добавлены дополнительные привязки клавиш для брайлевского дисплея MDV Lilli. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/241" target="_blank">#241</A>) 
<LI>Новые языки: болгарский и албанский.
</UL>

<H3>Изменения</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Чтобы переместить каретку к просмотровому курсору, теперь нужно дважды быстро нажать "переместить фокус к объекту навигатора" (настольная раскладка - NVDA+shift+numpadMinus, раскладка для ноутбука - NVDA+shift+backspace). Это освобождает больше клавиш для дальнейшего использования. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/837" target="_blank">#837</A>)
<LI>Чтобы услышать ASCII и шестнадцатиричное представление символа под просмотровым курсором, теперь нужно нажать "просмотреть текущий символ" трижды, а не дважды, поскольку по двойному нажатию теперь произносится фонетическое описание символа.
<LI>Речевой синтезатор eSpeak обновлен до версии 1.45.03. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1465" target="_blank">#1465</A>)
<LI>Таблицы разметки больше не произносятся в приложениях на основе Mozilla Gecko при перемещениях фокуса в режиме редактирования или за границами документа.
<LI>В Internet Explorer и других MSHTML элементах режим обзора теперь работает для документов внутри ARIA приложений. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1452" target="_blank">#1452</A>)
<LI>Транслятор Брайля liblouis обновлен до версии  2.3.0.
<LI>В режиме обзора при прыжке на элемент с помощью быстрой навигации или попадании на него фокусом теперь объявляется описание элемента, если оно есть.
<LI>Индикаторы выполнения теперь объявляются в режиме обзора.
<LI>Части страницы, у которых атрибут ARIA role установлен как presentation теперь пропускаются в Internet Explorer и других MSHTML элементах.
<LI>Теперь в пользовательском интерфейсе и документации NVDA виртуальный буфер упоминается как режим обзора, поскольку термин "виртуальный буфер" ни о чем не говорит большинству пользователей. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1509" target="_blank">#1509</A>)
<LI>Когда пользователь хочет скопировать свои настройки в системный профиль для использования на экране входа в систему и других защищенных экранах Windows, и эти настройкисодержат сторонние плагины, теперь появляется предупреждение о том, что копирование может представлять угрозу безопасности. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1426" target="_blank">#1426</A>)
<LI>Служба NVDA больше не запускает NVDA на других рабочих столах пользователя.
<LI>На Windows XP и Windows Vista, NVDA больше не использует UI Automation, даже если это доступно через обновление платформы. Хотя использование UI Automation может улучшить доступность некоторых современных приложений, на XP и Vista оно вызывает множество зависаний, аварийных завершений работы и, самое главное, потери производительности. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1437" target="_blank">#1437</A>)
<LI>В приложениях, использующих Mozilla Gecko 2 и более поздние версии (таких как Firefox 4 и выше), документ теперь может быть прочитан в режиме обзора еще до того, как он до конца загрузится. 
<LI>NVDA теперь сообщает состояние контейнера, когда фокус перемещается на элемент внутри него (например, если фокус перемещается внутри документа, который продолжает загружаться, она скажет "занято").
<LI>В пользовательском интерфейсе и документации NVDA больше не используются термины "первый дочерний" и "родительский" по отношению к объектной навигации, поскольку они оказались неудобными для многих пользователей.
<LI>"Свернуто" больше не сообщается для некоторых пунктов меню, у которых есть подменю.
<LI>Скрипт reportCurrentFormatting (NVDA+f) теперь сообщает форматирование на позиции просмотрового курсора, а не системной каретки/ фокуса. Поскольку по умолчанию просмотровый курсор следует за кареткой, большинство людей не заметят разницы. Впрочем это теперь позволяет пользователю узнавать форматирование при перемещении просмотрового курсора например в режиме плоского просмотра.
</UL>

<H3>Исправления</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Комбинированные списки, раскрытые в режиме обзора, больше не возвращают автоматически в режим обзора, когда режим редактирования был включен принудительно по NVDA+space. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1386" target="_blank">#1386</A>)
<LI>В документах Gecko (например, Firefox) и MSHTML (например, Internet Explorer) NVDA теперь корректно представляет определенный текст на одной и той же строке, который до этого был представлен в виде раздельных строк. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1378" target="_blank">#1378</A>)
<LI>Когда Брайль привязан к просмотру, и объект навигатора перемещается по документу в режиме обзора вручную или из-за изменения фокуса, брайлевский дисплей будет показывать соответствующее содержимое. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1406" target="_blank">#1406</A>, <A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1407" target="_blank">#1407</A>)
<LI>Когда произношение пунктуации полностью выключено, некоторые синтезаторы больше не произносят отдельные символы. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/332" target="_blank">#332</A>)
<LI>Больше не возникает проблемы при загрузке конфигурационного файла для синтезаторов, которые не поддерживают настройку голоса, таких как Audiologic Tts3. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1347" target="_blank">#1347</A>)
<LI>Меню Skype Extras теперь читается корректно. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/648" target="_blank">#648</A>)
<LI>Отмеченный флажок контроля яркости сигнала в диалоге настроек мыши больше не должен вызывать значительных задержек сигнала, когда мышь перемещается по экрану на Windows Vista/Windows 7 с включенным Aero. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1183" target="_blank">#1183</A>)
<LI>Когда NVDA настроена, чтобы использовать раскладку для ноутбука, комбинация клавиш NVDA+delete теперь работает, как задокументировано: сообщает размеры текущего объекта навигатора. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1498" target="_blank">#1498</A>)
<LI>NVDA теперь соответственно учитывает атрибут aria-selected в документах Internet Explorer.
<LI>Теперь при автоматическом переключении из режима обзора в режим редактирования NVDA будет сообщать информацию о контексте фокуса. Например, если фокус оказывается на элементе списка, сначала будет назван список. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1491" target="_blank">#1491</A>)
<LI>В Internet Explorer и других MSHTML элементах, списки ARIA теперь воспринимаются как списки, а не как элементы списка.
<LI>Когда фокус окажется в редакторах только для чтения, NVDA теперь будет говорить, что они только для чтения. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1436" target="_blank">#1436</A>)
<LI>В режиме обзора NVDA теперь корректно ведет себя с редакторами только для чтения.
<LI>В режиме обзора NVDA больше не переходит в режим редактирования, когда aria-activedescendant установлен; например, когда появляется конец списка, что происходит в некоторых элементах с автозаполнением.
<LI>В Adobe Reader, имя элемента теперь сообщается при перемещении фокуса или использовании быстрой навигации в режиме обзора.
<LI>В XFA PDF документах в Adobe Reader кнопки, ссылки и графические элементы теперь отображаются корректно.
<LI>В XFA PDF документах в Adobe Reader все элементы теперь отображаются на отдельных строках. Это изменение было вызвано тем, что большие разделы (иногда даже внутри документа) отображались слитно, что приводило к плохой структурированности этих документов.
<LI>Исправлены проблемы при попадании фокуса в поле редактора или выходе из него в XFA PDF документах Adobe Reader.
<LI>В XFA PDF документах в Adobe Reader теперь сообщаются изменения значения комбинированого списка в фокусе.
<LI>Самоотрисовывающиеся комбинированые списки, такие как, например, выбор цвета в Outlook Express, теперь доступны с NVDA. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1340" target="_blank">#1340</A>)
<LI>В языках, у которых пробел используется в качестве разделителя между числовыми группами, таких как французский и немецкий, числа в разных частях текста больше не произносятся как одно число. Эта проблема была особенно актуальной для чисел в ячейках таблиц. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/555" target="_blank">#555</A>)
<LI>Части страницы, у которых атрибут ARIA role установлен в description, в Internet Explorer и других MSHTML элементах теперь классифицируются, как статичный текст, а не поля редактирования.
<LI>Исправлены разнообразные проблемы, возникающие при нажатии tab, пока фокус на документе в режиме обзора (например, tab неправильно перемещал в строку адреса Internet Explorer). (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/720" target="_blank">#720</A>, <A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1367" target="_blank">#1367</A>)
<LI>Теперь, когда во время чтения попадается список, NVDA в английской локализации будет говорить, например, "list with 5 items" вместо "listwith 5 items". (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1515" target="_blank">#1515</A>)
<LI>В режиме помощи по вводу жесты будут заносится в лог, даже если скрипты, назначенные на них, не касаются помощи по вводу, например, прокрутка брайлевского дисплея вперед и назад.
<LI>В режиме помощи по вводу, когда клавиша-модификатор зажата на клавиатуре, NVDA больше не будет сообщать ее, если клавиша является модификатором для самой себя, например, NVDA+NVDA.
<LI>В документах Adobe Reader нажатие c или shift+c теперь перемещает по комбинированным спискам.
<LI>Выделенное состояние для выделяемых строк таблиц теперь сообщается точно так же, как и у элементов списка или дерева.

</P>
<H3>Новое</H3>
<UL>
<LI>В некоторых элементах управления NVDA теперь может определять цвета. автоматическое сообщение цвета включается в диалоге настроек форматирования документа. Также информацию о цвете можно получить, используя команду сообщения форматирования документа (NVDA+f).
 <UL>
 <LI>Сейчас NVDA определяет цвета в полях редактирования стандарта Iaccessible2 (например, как в приложениях от Mozilla), элементах типа RichEdit (wordpad), и в текстовых полях приложения IBM Lotus Symphony.
 </UL>
<LI>В виртуальных буферах теперь возможно выделять постранично (используя  shift+pageDown и shift+pageUp), а также по параграфам (используя shift+control+downArrow и shift+control+upArrow). (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/639" target="_blank">#639</A>)
<LI>NVDA теперь автоматически сообщает появляющийся новый текст в приложениях mIRC, PuTTY, Tera Term и SecureCRT. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/936" target="_blank">#936</A>)

<LI>Поддержка глобальных подключаемых модулей. Глобальные модули дадут возможность добавлять новые функции в NVDA, которые будут доступны во всех приложениях. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/281" target="_blank">#281</A>)
<LI>Теперь NVDA может издавать сигнал, если пользователь вводит букву с зажатой клавишей Shift при активной клавише CapsLock. Это можно выключить, сняв соответствующую галочку в диалоге настроек клавиатуры. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/663" target="_blank">#663</A>)
<LI>Теперь NVDA сообщает о наличии принудительных разрывов страницы при чтении в Microsoft Word. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/758" target="_blank">#758</A>)
<LI>Теперь NVDA читает маркированые и нумерованные списки при перемещении построчно в Microsoft Word. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/208" target="_blank">#208</A>)  
<LI>Теперь в NVDA можно активировать Режим сна для текущего приложения (NVDA+shift+s). Режим сна отключает все функции NVDA в приложении, отдавая все команды ввода непосредственно ему. Это полезно в приложениях, которые имеют свой речевой вывод и/или функцию чтения. Чтобы отключить Режим сна, нажмите эту команду еще раз.
<LI>Добавлена обработка дополнительных клавишь брайлевских дисплеев. См. секцию поддерживаемых брайлевских дисплеев в руководстве пользователя. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/209" target="_blank">#209</A>)

<H3>Изменения</H3>
<UL>
<LI>По умолчанию позиция объекта больше не объявляется в тех случаях, где она обычно получалась не коректно, а именно  в большинстве меню, области Выполнения приложений, области уведомлений и т.д. Однако, это можно включить обратно в диалоге настроек представления объектов.
<LI>Клавиатурная справка была переименована в Справку по вводу, чтобы показать, что теперь она охватывает не только клавиатурные комбинации.
<LI>В справке по вводу больше не сообщается расположение скрипта, назначенного комбинации, поскольку это не нужно для пользователя. ОДнако это сохраняется в лог для разработчиков или продвинутых пользователей.
<LI>Когда NVDA определяет, что она "подвисла" в текущем  приложении, то она все еще перехватывает клавиши-модификаторы NVDA, но передает другие клавиши непосредственно  системе. Это предотвращает нежелательное включение CapsLock и т.п. когда пользователь не заметил подвисания (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/939" target="_blank">#939</A>)
<LI>При использовании команды пропуска клавиш, все клавиши, включая повторения, будут передаваться в систему до тех пор, пока не будет отпущена последняя клавиша в сочетании.
<LI>Теперь если один из модификаторов нажать дважды быстро и удерживать после второго нажатия, то информация о повторе будет передаваться непосредственно приложению.
<LI>Клавиши регуляции громкости и отключения звука теперь сообщаются в справке по вводу. Это может быть полезно в случае, когда пользователь не знает какие клавиши отвечают за это в системе.
<LI>Горячая клавиша в меню NVDA параметры для настроек просмотрового курсора была изменена с R на C во избежании конфликта с вызовом настроек брайля.
</UL>

<H3>Исправления</H3>
<UL>
<LI>При добавлении новой словарной статьи в словарь, заголовок окна теперь "Добавить словарную статью", а не "Редактировать словарную статью". (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/924" target="_blank">#924</A>)
<LI>В диалоге словаря значения в колонках списка "Регулярное выражение" и "Регистр" теперь отображаются в соответствии с выбранным языком в NVDA, а не на английском.
<LI>В приложении AIM, в деревьях теперь сообщается позиция элемента.
<LI>В настройках голоса значения ползунков теперь увеличиваются по стрелке вверх/страница вверх/Home, а уменьшаются, соответственно, по стрелке вниз/страница вниз/End. Раньше регулировка происходила противоположными клавишами, что не соответствовало кольцу настроек синтезатора. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/221" target="_blank">#221</A>)
<LI>В виртуальных буферах с выключенным экранным представлением лишние пустые строки больше не отображаются.
<LI>Если модификатор NVDA нажат  дважды быстро , и при этом в промежутке была нажата другая клавиша, то второе нажатие модификатора NVDA не передается приложению.
<LI>В режиме справки по вводу, клавиши отвечающие за знаки пунктуации  проговариваются независимо от настроек пунктуации в NVDA. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/977" target="_blank">#977</A>)
<LI>В диалоге настроек клавиатуры, название раскладки теперь отображается соответственно выбранному языку в NVDA, а не на английском. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/558" target="_blank">#558</A>)
<LI>исправлено отображение некоторых элементов в документах Adobe Reader, которые выводились как пустые; Например, как ссылки в содержании руководства пользователя Apple iPhone IOS 4.1.
<LI>Кнопка "Использовать последнюю сохраненную конфигурацию как конфигурацию NVDA на экране входа в систему и других защищенных экранах" в общих настройках NVDA теперь работает, если она была нажата непосредственно после установки NVDA но до вхождения в защищенные экраны или экран входа в Windows. Раньше NVDA сообщала, что конфигурация была успешно скопирована, но обычно это не давало никакого эффекта. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1194" target="_blank">#1194</A>)
<LI>Теперь невозможно открыть два диалога настроек NVDA. Это решает проблему, когда один диалог настроек зависит от другого; Например, когда пользователь вызывает диалог выбора синтезатора, а в это время активен диалог настроек параметров голоса. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/603" target="_blank">#603</A>)
<LI>На операционных системах с включенным UAC, функция использования последней конфигурации как конфигурации NVDA в защищенных экранах больше не вызывает ошибку, если в имени пользователя системы есть пробелы. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/918" target="_blank">#918</A>)
<LI>В Internet Explorer и других элементах управления MSHTML, теперь NVDA отображает URL ссылки, если та не имеет имени. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/633" target="_blank">#633</A>)
<LI>NVDA больше не игнорирует фокус в меню в AOL Instant Messenger 7. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/655" target="_blank">#655</A>)
<LI>Наименование типа ошибки теперь корректно произносится при проверке правописания в Microsoft Word (например, нет в словаре, грамматическая или пунктуационная  ошибка). Раньше это означалось только как грамматическая ошибка. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/883" target="_blank">#883</A>)
<LI>Набор текста в Microsoft Word при использовании брайлевского дисплея больше не должен вводить искаженный текст или вызывать редкие подвисания, если также нажата клавиша приведения курсора. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1212" target="_blank">#1212</A>) Однако, это вызвало проблему в том, что арабский текст теперь не будет отображаться в Word 2003 и ниже  на брайлевском дисплее. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/627" target="_blank">#627</A>)
<LI>При нажатии клавиши Delete в полях редактирования, положение курсора и текст на брайлевском дисплее теперь всегда обновляется, чтобы показать изменения. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/947" target="_blank">#947</A>)
<LI>Изменения динамического содержания страниц в документах Gecko2 (таких, как страницы Firefox 4), в то время как открыто несколько вкладок, теперь должны озвучиваться. Раньше NVDA реагировала только на изменения в первой вкладке. (Mozilla bug 610985)
<LI>NVDA теперь корректно сообщает советы в диалоге проверки правописания в Microsoft Word. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/704" target="_blank">#704</A>)
<LI>В Internet Explorer и других элементах MSHTML, NVDA теперь больше не отображает позиции для ссылоквнутри страницы как пустые ссылки в виртуальном буфере. Теперь они просто невидимы, как это и должно быть. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1326" target="_blank">#1326</A>)
<LI>Объектная навигация возле или в пределах стандартных элементов  группировок Windows теперь работает более корректно и не асимметрична.
<LI>В Firefox и других элементах, построенных на Gecko, NVDA больше не застревает на вложенных фреймах, если таковой загрузится раньше всего главного  документа.
<LI>NVDA теперь объявляет непосредственно следующий символ при удалении клавишей NumpadDelete. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/286" target="_blank">#286</A>)
<LI>на экране входа в Windows XP NVDA снова   сообщает выбранное имя пользователя при изменении выбора.
<LI>Исправлена проблема, возникающая в консольных окнах Windows при включенном чтении номеров строк.
<LI>Список элементов диалога для виртуальных буферов теперь удобен в использовании и для зрячих пользователей. Все элементы управления видимы на экране. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1321" target="_blank">#1321</A>)
<LI>Диалог со списком статей в речевых словарях стал более читабелен для зрячих пользователей. Список теперь достаточного размера, чтобы показать все свои колонки на экране. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/90" target="_blank">#90</A>)
<LI>При использовании брайлевских дисплеев ALVA BC640/BC680 NVDA больше не игнорирует нажатия клавишь на дисплее, находящихся в нажатом состоянии после отпускания других клавишь.
<LI>Adobe Reader X теперь не завершает работу аварийно при переходе фокуса из окна опций документа без тегов в диалог обработки документа. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1218" target="_blank">#1218</A>)
<LI>NVDA теперь переключается на установленный брайлевский дисплей при выполнении команды возврата к сохраненной конфигурации. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1346" target="_blank">#1346</A>)
<LI>Мастер проектов в Visual Studio 2008 снова озвучивается корректно. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/974" target="_blank">#974</A>)
<LI>Исправлена ошибка, из-за которой NVDA совсем не работала в программах, содержащих в названии исполняемого файла символы, не входящие в таблицу ASCII, например русские символы. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1352" target="_blank">#1352</A>)
<LI>При построчном чтении в AkelPad с включенным переносом слов NVDA больше не добавляет первый символ следующей строки в конец текущей.

<H3>Изменения для разработчиков</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Для подготовки дерева исходников, создания бинарной сборки, портабельного архива, инсталлятора и т.д. теперь используется SCons. См. файл readme.txt в корне дерева исходников для подробностей.
<LI>Названия клавишь, используемые NVDA (в т.ч. и в файлах сопоставления) были сделаны более дружественными и логичными. Например, upArrow вместо extendedUp и numpadPageUp вместо prior. См. модуль vkCodes для полного списка.
<LI>Любой пользовательский ввод теперь представляется экземпляром класса inputCore.InputGesture. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/601" target="_blank">#601</A>)
 <UL>
 <LI>Каждый источник ввода (input source) наследуется от базового класса InputGesture.
 <LI>Нажатия клавишь на стандартной клавиатуре представлены классом keyboardHandler.KeyboardInputGesture.
 <LI>Нажатия клавишь, колесиков и прочих элементов на брайлевских дисплеях представляются наследниками класса braille.BrailleDisplayGesture. Они реализуются в каждом драйвере брайлевского дисплея.
 </UL>
<LI>Жесты ввода (input gestures) можно сопоставить скриптабельным объектам (ScriptableObject) по средством метода ScriptableObject.BindGesture()  у экземпляра или свойством класса __gestures, которое представляет из себя словарь, сопоставляющий идентификаторы жестов (gesture identifiers) названиям скриптов. См. документацию к baseObject.ScriptableObject. для подробностей.
<LI>Модули приложений больше не имеют файлов сопоставления клавишь (key map files). Вместо этого, все сопоставления должны назначаться в самом модуле.

<UL>
<LI>Команды озвучить объект (NVDA+numpadAdd),следующий объект в потоке ((NVDA+shift+numpad6), и предыдущий файл в потоке (NVDA+shift+numpad4) удалены из-за большого количества сбоев при их выполнении, а также, чтобы освободить сочетания клавиш для других возможных функций.
<LI>Теперь, в диалоговом окне синтезатора, озвучивается только видимое имя синтезатора. Ранее ему предшествовало название драйвера, не имеющее отношения к работе пользователя.
<LI>Находясь внутри встроенного объекта, или виртуального буфера, встроенного в другой буфер (например, flash), теперь, по команде nvda+control+пробел можно выйти из встроенного объекта или виртуального буфера в основной документ. Ранее для этого использовалось сочетание клавиш nvda+пробел. Теперь команда nvda+пробел используется только для переключения между режимом просмотра и режимом форм. 
<LI>Если просмотрщику речи (запускается из меню Инструменты) передан фокус (например, было выполнено нажатие по щелчку) текст не изменится пока не сместится фокус. Это делает выделение текста (например, для копирования) гораздо более простым.
<LI>Окна просмотрщика блогов и консоли Python открываются в развернутом виде.
<LI>Если в рабочей области Microsoft Excel выделено более одной ячейки, озвучивается диапазон выделения, а не только активная ячейка. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/763" target="_blank">#763</A>)

<LI>При использовании встроенного синтезатора espeak  одновременное проигрывание речи и тоновых сигналов больше не приводит в особых случаях к зависаниям на некоторых системах. Такое могло произойти, на пример, при копировании больших объемов данных в проводнике windows.
<LI>NVDA не сообщает  о состоянии "занято" (обновление или перезагрузка страницы) для документов в firefox, которые в данный момент не видны на экране. Это также приводило к нежелательному чтению статусной строки активного приложения.
<LI>При переключении раскладки клавиатуры (control+shift или alt+shift) на речь и брайль выводится полное имя  раскладки. Раньше эта информация выводилась только на синтезатор и альтернативные раскладки (на пример "Dvorak") вобще не произносились.
<LI>Если чтение таблиц отключено, табличная информация больше не произносится при изменении фокуса.
<LI>Некоторые проблемные стандартные деревья в 64 битных приложениях (На пример содержание  в Microsoft HTML Help) теперь доступны. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/473" target="_blank">#473</A>)
<LI>Fixed some problems with logging of messages containing non-ASCII characters. This could cause spurious errors in some cases on non-English systems. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/581" target="_blank">#581</A>)
<LI>Информация в диалоге "о программе" теперь отображается на языке пользователя, а не только на английском, как это было ранее. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/586" target="_blank">#586</A>)

<LI>Если «NVDA» определяет собственное зависание по какой-либо причине, она перестает перехватывать нажатия клавиш, давая пользователю больше возможностей по восстановлению системы. 
<LI>Добавлена возможность перетаскивания объектов (Aria drag and drop) в Mozilla Gecko.
<LI>При перемещении внутри виртуального буфера теперь озвучивается заголовок текущего документа, текущая строка, или выделенный текст. Это дает возможность перемещаться по веб-странице, как по обычному документу. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/210" target="_blank">#210</A>)
<LI>добавилась возможность взаимодействия с встроеными объектами, такими как flash-содержимое Sun Java, . Для передачи фокуса объекту нажмите на нем “энтер”(как для полей ввода и прочих элементов форм). Если объект доступен, то вы сможете взаимодействовать с ним как с простым приложением (Нажимайте таб для перемещения по окну). Для возвращения в в буфер к просмотру страницы нажмите NVDA+space. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/431" target="_blank">#431</A>)
<LI>Добавлены горячие клавиши o, shift+o для перемещения к следующему/предыдущему встроенному объекту соответственно.

</UL>

<H3>Изменения</H3>
<UL>
<LI>NVDA больше не озвучивает "NVDA готов" во время запуска.
<LI>Звуки по загрузке и выгрузке NVDA, теперь, воспроизводятся через звуковое устройство, на которое выводится речь NVDA, вместо воспроизведения через устройство "Windows", выбранное по умолчанию. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/164" target="_blank">#164</A>)
<LI>Улучшено озвучивание строки состояния. Теперь NVDA может озвучивать изменения как речью, так и при помощи речи и сигналов одновременно.
<LI>Теперь, при попадании в фокус,  не озвучиваются такие настраиваемые элементы управления, как панель, приложение, фрейм,если только они не являются безымянными. 
<LI>По команде «копировать размеченный текст в буфер обмена» (NVDA+f10) теперь копируется текст от начала фрагмента до текущей позиции просмотрового курсора, включая символ под курсором. Это позволяет копировать последний символ строки, что ранее было невозможно. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/430" target="_blank">#430</A>)
<LI>Удален скрипт местоположения объекта (ctrl+NVDA+numpad5). Эта комбинация клавиш не работала на некоторых клавиатурах, и скрипт оказался не слишком востребованным.
<LI>Скрипт, озвучивающий размеры текущего объекта, переназначен на сочетание клавиш NVDA+numpadDelete. Старая комбинация не работала на некоторых клавиатурах. Вместо координат объекта, теперь произносятся его ширина и высота.
<LI>Улучшена работа NVDA (особенно на нетбуках) в ситуациях, когда воспроизводится ряд частых сигналов: например, при быстром перемещении мыши с включенным озвучиванием координат. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/396" target="_blank">#396</A>)
<LI>Звук ошибки NVDA больше не будет проигрываться в релиз кандидатах и финальных версиях. Запись ошибок в журнал по прежнему ведется 
</UL>

<H3>Исправления</H3>
<UL>
<LI>При запуске NVDA из 8.3 dos пути, но программа установлена в папку по длинному пути (Например, "progra~1" вместо "program files") NVDA правильно определит это и, соответственно, загрузит пользовательские настройки.
<LI>Чтение заголовка окна на переднем плане по команде "NVDA+t", теперь, корректно работает и в меню.
<LI>На Брайлевском дисплее больше не отображается излишняя информация, например, при фокусе на не размеченной области.
<LI>Больше не озвучивается излишняя информацияпри смене фокуса в "Java" или "Lotus". 	
<LI>Поддержка поля ввода поискового запроса в справке (Windows Help (CHM) viewer). До устранения бага невозможно было прочитать текущее введенное слово, поскольку оно постоянно менялось.
-  Правильно озвучивается нумерация страниц в Microsoft Word.
<LI>Улучшено взаимодействие с диалоговыми окнами Microsoft Word (диалог выбора шрифта). По контроллерам теперь можно перемещаться клавишами стрелок.
<LI>Улучшена поддержка консолей DOS. Теперь читается содержимое консолей, которые раньше виделись как пустые. 	 * «NVDA» больше не прерывается при нажатии ctrl+break.
<LI>В Windows Vista и предыдущих версиях, если, при завершении инсталляции выбрано «Запустить NVDA, она запустится с обычными правами пользователя.
<LI>При произнесении набираемого текста правильно обрабатывается клавиша Backspace. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/306" target="_blank">#306</A>)

<LI>Корректно обрабатываются маркеры в Mozilla gecko. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/156" target="_blank">#156</A>)
<LI>Больше автоматически не перемещается фокус в поля редактирования, в которых, при изменении фокуса, обновляется текст. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/220" target="_blank">#220</A>)
<LI>Теперь NVDA будет пробовать возобновить собственную работоспособность в некоторых ситуациях, которые до этого приводили к полному зависанию. На самодиагностику и восстановление в отдельных случаях может уйти до 10 секунд.
<LI>Если языком «NVDA» выбран язык системы по умолчанию, То используется язык, установленный в качестве основного в региональных настройках Windows. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/353" target="_blank">#353</A>)
<LI>NVDA теперь определяет контроллеры в AIM 7.
<LI>NVDA больше не вылетает при выполнении команды «Пропуск клавиши». Ранее, если клавиша была нажата и удерживалась, NVDA зависала, и ее приходилось перезапускать. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/413" target="_blank">#413</A>)
<LI>Больше не игнорируется панель задач, когда на нее перемещается курсор. Такое часто случалось при выходе из приложений. “NVDA» не сообщала о том, что фокус изменился.
<LI>В приложениях, использующих Java Access Bridge (включая OpenOffice.org) NVDA теперь правильно сообщает о включении/отключении нумерации строк.
<LI>Корректно обрабатывается команда копирования размеченного фрагмента (NVDA+f10), в случаях, когда курсор находится перед маркером, отмечающим начало фрагмента. Ранее, в подобных ситуациях возникали проблемы, в частности, зависания при работе в Блокноте. 
<LI>Больше самопроизвольно не изменяются громкость и высота тембра синтезатора eSpeak, что раньше наблюдалось, если в тексте встречался управляющий символ 0x1. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/437" target="_blank">#437</A>)
<LI>По команде »произнести выделенный текст» (NVDA+shift+стрелка вверх), в тех объектах, где выделение текста не поддерживается, NVDA теперь сообщает о том, что выделенного текста нет.
<LI>Исправлена ошибка, приводившая к зависанию NVDA при нажатии клавиши enter на какой-либо кнопке в Миранде (Miranda-Aim). (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/440" target="_blank">#440</A>)
<LI>Исправлена обработка текущей строки, или выделенного текста при чтении по буквам, либо копировании объекта навигатора. 
<LI>Реализован обход ошибки в windows, из-за которой в ссылках, которые можно найти в диалогах “свойства папки” и других диалогах проводника и Internet Explorer к тексту ссылки добавлялся мусор (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/451" target="_blank">#451</A>) 
<LI>Исправлена команда произнесения даты и времени (NVDA+f12). В некоторых локалях дата произносилась не до конца. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/471" target="_blank">#471</A>)
<LI>Fixed the issue where the system screen reader flag was sometimes inappropriately cleared after interacting with secure Windows screens. This could cause problems in applications which check the screen reader flag, including Skype, Adobe Reader and Jart. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/462" target="_blank">#462</A>)
<LI>In an Internet Explorer 6 combo box, the active item is now reported when it is changed. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/342" target="_blank">#342</A>)
</UL>

<H2>0.6p3</H2>
<H3>Новое</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Поскольку для «NVDA» недоступна строка формулы в Microsoft Excel, создано специальное диалоговое окно для NVDA, которое появляется, когда пользователь нажимает f2 на ячейке.
<LI>Поддержка форматирования в элементах управления стандарта IAccessible2 text, включая приложения Mozilla
<LI>Где возможно, озвучиваются грамматические ошибки. Параметр доступен из диалога настроек форматирования документа.
<LI>Добавилась настройка, изменяющая озвучивание строк состояния. Сигнал может издаваться при изменении всех, или только видимых строк состояния. При желании, «NVDA» можно настроить на проговаривание каждых 10%.
<LI>Теперь определяются ссылки в  элементах управления richedit.
<LI>В большинстве редактируемых элементов управления курсор мыши теперь можно перемещать на символ, находящийся под просмотровым курсором. Прежде, он перемещался только к центру элемента управления.
<LI>В виртуальных буферах, при помощи просмотрового курсора, теперь можно читать текст непосредственно самого буфера, а не только текст, находящийся внутри объекта навигатора, часто неинформативный для пользователя. Это значит, что по виртуальному буферу можно перемещаться иерархически, используя объектную навигацию, и просмотровый курсор будет следовать за курсором навигатора.
<LI>Handle some additional states on Java controls.
<LI>If the title command (NVDA+t) is pressed twice, it spells the title. If pressed thrice, it is copied to  the clipboard.
<LI>Keyboard help now reads the names of modifier keys when pressed alone.
<LI>Key names announced by keyboard help are now translatable.
<LI>Added support for the recognized text field in SiRecognizer. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/198" target="_blank">#198</A>)
<LI>Support for braille displays!
<LI>Added a command (NVDA+c) to report the text on the Windows clipboard. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/193" target="_blank">#193</A>)
<LI>In virtualBuffers, if NVDA automatically switches to focus mode, you can use the escape key to switch back  to browse mode. NVDA+space can still also be used.
<LI>In virtual buffers, when the focus changes or the caret is moved, NVDA can automatically switch to focus  mode or browse mode as appropriate for the control under the caret. This is configured from the Virtual Buffers  dialog. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/157" target="_blank">#157</A>)
<LI>Rewritten SAPI4 synthesizer driver which replaces the sapi4serotek and sapi4activeVoice drivers and should fix the problems encountered with these drivers.
<LI>The NVDA application now includes a manifest, which means that it no longer runs in compatibility mode in Windows Vista.
<LI>The configuration file and speech dictionaries are now saved in the user's application data directory if NVDA was installed using the installer. This is necessary for Windows Vista and also allows multiple users to have  individual NVDA configurations.
<LI>Added support for position information for IAccessible2 controls.
<LI>Added the ability to copy text to the clipboard using the review cursor. NVDA+f9 sets the start marker to the current position of the review cursor. NVDA+f10 retrieves the text between the start marker and the current position of the review cursor and copies it to the clipboard. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/240" target="_blank">#240</A>)
<LI>Added support for some edit controls in pinacle tv software.
<LI>When announcing selected text for long selections (512 characters or more), NVDA now speaks the number of selected characters, rather than speaking the entire selection. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/249" target="_blank">#249</A>)
</UL>

<H3>Changes</H3>
<UL>
<LI>If the audio output device is set to use the Windows default device (Microsoft Sound Mapper), NVDA will now switch to the new default device for eSpeak and tones when the default device changes. For example, NVDA will switch to a USB audio device if it automatically becomes the default device when it is connected.
<LI>Improve performance of eSpeak with some Windows Vista audio drivers.
<LI>reporting of links, headings, tables, lists and block quotes can now be configured from the Document Formatting settings dialog. Previously to configure these settings for virtual buffers, the virtual buffer settings dialog would have been used. Now all documents share this configuration.
<LI>Rate is now the default setting in the speech synthesizer settings ring.
<LI>Improve the loading and unloading of appModules.
<LI>The title command (NVDA+t) now only reports the title instead of the entire object. If the foreground object has no name, the application's process name is used.
<LI>Instead of virtual buffer pass through on and off, NVDA now reports focus mode (pass through on) and browse mode (pass through off).
<LI>Voices are now stored in the configuration file by ID instead of by index. This makes voice settings more reliable across systems and configuration changes. The voice setting will not be preserved in old configurations and an error may be logged the first time a synthesizer is used. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/19" target="_blank">#19</A>)
<LI>The level of a tree view item is now announced first if it has changed from the previously focused item for all tree views. Previously, this was only occurring for native Windows (SysTreeView32) tree views.
</UL>

<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The last chunk of audio is no longer cut off when using NVDA with eSpeak on a remote desktop server.
<LI>Fix problems with saving speech dictionaries for certain voices.

<LI>If speak typed words is enabled, announce the word when enter is pressed.
<LI>Fix some character set issues in richedit documents.
<LI>The NVDA log viewer now uses richedit instead of just edit to display the log. This improves reading by word with NVDA.
<LI>Fix some issues related to embedded objects in richedit controls.
<LI>NVDA now reads page numbers in Microsoft Word. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/120" target="_blank">#120</A>)
<LI>Fix the issue where tabbing to a checked checkbox in a Mozilla Gecko virtual buffer and pressing space would not announce that the checkbox was being unchecked.
<LI>Correctly report partially checked checkboxes in Mozilla applications.
<LI>If the text selection expands or shrinks in both directions, read the selection as one chunk instead of two.
<LI>When reading with the mouse, text in Mozilla Gecko edit fields should now be read.
<LI>Say all should no longer cause certain SAPI5 synthesizers to crash.
<LI>Fixed an issue which meant that text selection changes were not being read in Windows standard edit controls before the first focus change after NVDA was started.
<LI>Fix mouse tracking in Java objects. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/185" target="_blank">#185</A>)
<LI>NVDA no longer reports Java tree view items with no children as being collapsed.
<LI>Announce the object with focus when a Java window comes to the foreground. Previously, only the top-level Java object was announced.
<LI>The eSpeak synthesizer driver no longer stops speaking completely after a single error.
<LI>Fix the issue whereby updated voice parameters (rate, pitch, etc.) were not saved when the voice was changed from the synthesizer settings ring.
<LI>Improved the speaking of typed characters and words.
<LI>Some new text that was previously not spoken in text console applications (such as some text adventure games) is now spoken.
<LI>NVDA now ignores focus changes in background windows. Previously, a background focus change could be treated as if the real focus changed.
<LI>Improved the detection of the focus when leaving context menus. Previously, NVDA often didn't react at all when leaving a context menu.
<LI>NVDA now announces when the context menu is activated in the Start menu.
<LI>The classic Start menu is now announced as Start menu instead of Application menu.
<LI>Improved the reading of alerts such as those encountered in Mozilla Firefox. The text should no longer be read multiple times and other extraneous information will no longer be read. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/248" target="_blank">#248</A>)
<LI>The text of focusable, read-only edit fields will no longer be included when retrieving the text of dialogs. This fixes, for example, the automatic reading of the entire license agreement in installers.
<LI>NVDA no longer announces the unselection of text when leaving some edit controls (example: Internet Explorer address bar, Thunderbird 3 email address fields).
<LI>When opening plain text emails in Outlook Express and Windows Mail, focus is correctly placed in the message ready for the user to read it. Previously the user had to press tab or click on the message in order to use cursor keys to read it.
<LI>Fixed several major issues with the "Speak command keys" functionality.
<LI>NVDA can now read text past 65535 characters in standard edit controls (e.g. a large file in Notepad).
<LI>Improved line reading in MSHTML edit fields (Outlook Express editable messages and Internet Explorer text input fields).
<LI>NVDA no longer sometimes freezes completely when editing text in OpenOffice. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/148" target="_blank">#148</A>, <A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/180" target="_blank">#180</A>)

<LI>Support for IAccessible2 enabled applications such as Mozilla Firefox when running NVDA from portable media, with out having to register any special Dll files
<LI>Fix a crash with the virtualBuffers Links List in Gecko applications. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/48" target="_blank">#48</A>)
<LI>NVDA should no longer crash Mozilla Gecko applications such as Firefox and Thunderbird if NVDA is running with higher privilages than the Mozilla Gecko application. E.g. NVDA is  running as Administrator.
<LI>Speech dictionaries (previously User dictionaries) now can be either case sensitive or insensitive, and the patterns can optionally be regular expressions. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/39" target="_blank">#39</A>)
<LI>Whether or not NVDA uses a 'screen layout' mode for virtual buffer documents can now be configured from a settings dialog
<LI>No longer report anchor tags with no href in Gecko documents as links. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/47" target="_blank">#47</A>)
<LI>The NVDA find command now remembers what you last searched for, across all applications. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/53" target="_blank">#53</A>)
<LI>Fix issues where the checked state would not be announced for some checkboxes and radio buttons in virtualBuffers
<LI>VirtualBuffer pass-through mode is now specific to each document, rather than NVDA globally. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/33" target="_blank">#33</A>)
<LI>Fixed some sluggishness with focus changes and incorrect speech interuption which sometimes occured when using NVDA on a system that had been on standby or was rather slow
<LI>Improve support for combo boxes in Mozilla Firefox. Specifically when arrowing around them text isn't repeated, and when jumping out of them, ancestor controls are not announced unnecessarily. Also virtualBuffer commands now work when focused on one  when you are in a virtualBuffer.
<LI>Improve accuracy of finding the statusbar in many applications. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/8" target="_blank">#8</A>)
<LI>Added the NVDA interactive Python console tool, to enable developers to look at and manipulate NVDA's internals as it is running
<LI>sayAll, reportSelection and reportCurrentLine scripts now work properly when in virtualBuffer pass-through mode. (<A HREF="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/52" target="_blank">#52</A>)
<LI>The increase rate and decrease rate scripts have been removed. Users should use the synth settings ring scripts (control+nvda+arrows) or the Voice settings dialog

<H2>0.6p1</H2>
<H3>Access to web content with new in-process virtualBuffers (so far for Mozilla Gecko applications including Firefox3 and Thunderbird3)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Load times have been improved almost by a factor of thirty (you no longer have to wait at all for most web pages to load in to the buffer)
<LI>Added a links list (NVDA+f7)
<LI>Improved the find dialog (control+nvda+f) so that it performs a case-insencitive search, plus fixed a few focus issues with that dialog box.
<LI>It is now possible to select and copy text in the new virtualBuffers
<LI>By default the new virtualBuffers represent the document in a screen layout (links and controls are not on separate lines unless they really are visually). You can toggle this feature with NVDA+v.
<LI>It is possible to move by paragraph with control+upArrow and control+downArrow.
<LI>Improved support for dynamic content
<LI>Improved over all accuracy of reading lines and fields when arrowing up and down.
</UL>

<H3>Internationalization</H3>
<UL>
<LI>It is now possible to type accented characters that rely on a "dead character", while NVDA is running.
<LI>NVDA now announces when the keyboard layout is changed (when pressing alt+shift).
<LI>The announce date and time feature now takes the system's current regional and language options in to account.

<LI>added ukrainian translation by Aleksey Sadovoy 
</UL>

<H3>Speech</H3>
<UL>
<LI>NVDA now comes packaged with eSpeak 1.33 which contains many improvements, among those are improved languages, named variants, ability to speak faster.
<LI>The voice settings dialog now allows you to change the variant of a synthesizer if it supports one. Variant is usually a slight variation on the current voice. (eSpeak supports variants).
<LI>Added the ability to change the inflection of a voice in the voice settings dialog if the current synthesizer supports this. (eSpeak supports inflection).
<LI>Added the ability to turn off speaking of object position information(e.g. 1 of 4). This option can be found in the Object presentation settings dialog.
<LI>NVDA can now beep when speaking a capital letter. This can be turned on and off with a check box in the voice settings dialog. Also added a raise pitch for capitals check box to configure whether NVDA should actually do its normal pitch raise for capitals. So now you can have either raise pitch, say cap, or beep, for capitals.
<LI>Added the ability to pause speech in NVDA (like found in Voice Over for the Mac). When NVDA is speaking something, you can press the control or shift keys to silence speech just like normal, but if you then tap the shift key again (as long as you havn't pressed any other keys) speech will continue from exactly where it left off.
<LI>Added a virtual synthDriver which outputs text to a window instead of speaking via a speech synthesiser. This should be more pleasant for sighted developers who are not used to speech synthesis but want to know what is spoken by NVDA. There are probably still some bugs, so feedback is most definitely welcome.
<LI>NVDA no longer by default speaks punctuation, you can enable speaking of punctuation with NVDA+p.
<LI>eSpeak by default now speaks quite a bit slower, which should make it easier for people who are using eSpeak for the first time, when installing or starting to use NVDA.
<LI>Added user dictionaries to NVDA. These allow you to make NVDA speak certain text differently. There are three dictionaries: default, voice, and temporary. Entries you add to the default dictionary will happen all the time in NVDA. Voice dictionaries are specific to the current synthesizer and voice you currently have set. And temporary dictionary is  for those times you quickly want to set a rule while you are doing a particular task, but you don't want it to be perminant (it will disappear if you close NVDA). For now the rules are regular expressions, not just normal text.
<LI>Synthesizers can now use any audio output device on your system, by setting the output device combo box in the Synthesizer dialog before selecting the synthesizer you want.
</UL>

<H3>Performance</H3>
<UL>
<LI>NVDA no longer takes up a huge amount of system memory , when editing messages in mshtml edit controls
<LI>Improved performance when reviewing text inside many controls that do not actually have a real cursor. e.g. MSN Messenger history window, treeview items, listview items etc.
<LI>Improved performance in rich edit documents.
<LI>NVDA should no longer slowly creep up in system memory size for no reason
<LI>Fixed bugs when  trying to focus on a dos console window more than three or so times. NVDA did have a tendency to completely crash.
</UL>

<H3>Key commands</H3>
<UL>
<LI>NVDA+shift+numpad6 and NVDA+shift+numpad4 allow you to navigate to the next or previous object in flow respectively. This means that you can navigate in an application by only using these two keys with out having to worry about going up by parent, or down to first child as you move around the object hyerarchy. For instance in a web browser such as firefox, you could navigate the document by object, by just using these two keys. If next in flow or previous in flow takes you up and out of an object, or down in to an object, ordered beeps indicate the direction.
<LI>You can now configure voice settings with out opening the voice settings dialog, by using the Synth Settings Ring. The synth settings ring is a group of voice settings you can toggle through by pressing control+NVDA+right and control+NVDA+left. To change a setting use control+NVDA+up and control+NVDA+down.
<LI>Added a command to report the current selection in edit fields (NVDA+shift+upArrow).
<LI>Quite a few NVDA commands that speak text (such as report current line etc) now can spell the text if pressed twice quickly.
<LI>the capslock, numpad insert and extended insert can all be used as the NVDA modifier key. Also if one of these keys is used, pressing the key twice with out pressing any other keys will send the key through to the operating system, just like you'd pressed the key with out NVDA running. To make one of these keys be the NVDA modifier key, check its checkbox in the Keyboard settings dialog (used to be called the keyboard echo dialog).
</UL>

<H3>Application support</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Improved support for Firefox3 and Thunderbird3 documents. Load times have been improved by almost a factor of thirty, a screen layout is used by default (press nvda+v to toggle between this and no screen layout), a links list (nvda+f7 has been added), the find dialog (control+nvda+f) is now case-insensitive, much better support for dynamic content, selecting and copying text is now possible.
<LI>In the MSN Messenger and Windows Live Messenger history windows, it is now possible to select and copy text.
<LI>Improved support for the audacity application
<LI>Added support for a few edit/text controls in Skype
<LI>Improved support for Miranda instant messenger application
<LI>Fixed some focus issues when opening html and plain text messages in Outlook Express. 
<LI>Outlook express newsgroup message fields are now labeled correctly
<LI>NVDA can now read the addresses in the Outlook Express message fields (to/from/cc etc)
<LI>NVDA should be now more accurate at announcing the next message in out look express when deleting a message from the message list.
</UL>

<H3>APIs and toolkits</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Improved object navigation for MSAA objects. If a window has a system menu, title bar, or scroll bars, you can now navigate to them.
<LI>Added support for the IAccessible2 accessibility API. A part from the ability to announce more control types, this also allows NVDA to access the cursor in applications such as Firefox 3 and Thunderbird 3, allowing you to navigate, select or edit text.
<LI>Added support for Scintilla edit controls (such controls can be found in Notepad++ or Tortoise SVN).
<LI>Added support for Java applications (via the Java Access Bridge). This can provide basic support for Open Office (if Java is enabled), and any other stand-alone Java application. Note that java applets with in a web browser may not work yet.
</UL>

<H3>Mouse</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Improved support for reading what is under the mouse pointer as it moves. It is now much faster, and it also now has the ability in some controls such as standard edit fields, Java and IAccessible2 controls, to read the current word, not just the current object. This may be of some used to vision impared people who just want to read a specific bit of text with the mouse.
<LI>Added a new config option, found in the mouse settings dialog. Play audio when mouse moves, when checked, plays a 40 ms beep each time the mouse moves, with its pitch (between 220 and 1760 hz) representing the y axis, and left/right volume, representing the x axis. This enables a blind person to get a rough idea of where the mouse is on the screen as its being moved. This feature also depends on reportObjectUnderMouse also being turned on. So this means that if you quickly need to disable both beeps and announcing of objects, then just press NVDA+m. The beeps are also louder or softer depending on how bright the screen is at that point.
</UL>

<H3>Object presentation and interaction</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Improved support for most common treeview controls. NVDA now tells you how many items are in the branch when you expand it. It also announces the level when moving in and out of branches. And, it announces the current item number and number of items, according to the current branch, not the entire treeview.
<LI>Improved what is announced when focus changes as you move around applications or the operating system. Now instead of just hearing the control you land on, you hear information about any controls this control is positioned inside of. For instance if you tab and land on a button inside a groupbox, the groupbox will also get announced.
<LI>NVDA now tries to speak the message inside many dialog boxes as they appear. This is accurate most of the time, though there are still many dialogs that arn't as good as they could be.
<LI>Added a report object descriptions checkbox to the object presentation settings dialog. Power users may wish to sometimes uncheck this to stop NVDA announcing a lot of extra descriptions on particular controls,  such as in Java applications.
<LI>NVDA automatically announces selected text in edit controls when focus moves to them. If there isn't any selected text, then it just announces the current line like usual.
<LI>NVDA is a lot more careful now when it plays beeps to indicate progress bar changes in applications. It no longer goes crazy in Eclipse applications such as Lotus Notes/Symphony, and Accessibility Probe.
</UL>

<H3>User Interface</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Removed the NVDA interface window, and replaced it with a simple NVDA popup menu.
<LI>NVDA's user interface settings dialog is now called General Settings. It also contains an extra setting: a combo box to set the log level, for what messages should go to NVDA's log file. Note that NVDA's log file is now called nvda.log not debug.log.
<LI>Removed the report object group names checkBox from the object presentation settings dialog, reporting of group names now is handled differently.
</UL>

<H2>0.5</H2>
<UL>
<LI>NVDA now has a built-in synthesizer called eSpeak, developed by Jonathan Duddington.It is very responsive and lite-weight, and has support for many different languages. Sapi synthesizers can still be used, but eSpeak will  be used by default. eSpeak does not depend on any special software to be installed, so it can be used with NVDA on any computer, on a USB thumb drive, or anywhere. For more info on eSpeak, or to find other versions, go to <A HREF="https://espeak.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">https://espeak.sourceforge.net/</A>.

 </UL>
<LI>Fix bug where the wrong character was being announced when pressing delete in Internet Explorer / Outlook Express editable panes.
<LI>Added support for more edit fields in Skype.
<LI>VirtualBuffers only get loaded when focus is on the window that needs to be loaded. This fixes some problems when the preview pane is turned on in Outlook Express.
<LI>Added commandline arguments to NVDA:
<LI>-m, --minimal: do not play startup/exit sounds and do not show the interface on startup if set to do so.
<LI>-q, --quit: quit any other already running instance of NVDA and then exit
<LI>-s, --stderr-file fileName: specify where NVDA should place uncaught errors and exceptions
<LI>-d, --debug-file fileName: specify where NVDA should place debug messages
<LI>-c, --config-file: specify an alternative configuration file
<LI>-h, -help: show a help message listing commandline arguments
<LI>Fixed bug where punctuation symbols would not be translated to the appropriate language, when using a language other than english, and when speak typed characters was turned on.
<LI>Added Slovak language files thanks to Peter Vagner 
<LI>Added a Virtual Buffer settings dialog and a Document Formatting settings dialog, from Peter Vagner.
<LI>Added French translation thanks to Michel Such 
<LI>Added a script to toggle beeping of progress bars on and off (insert+u). Contributed by Peter Vagner.
<LI>Made more messages in NVDA be translatable for other languages. This includes script descriptions when in keyboard help.
<LI>Added a find dialog to the virtualBuffers (internet Explorer and Firefox). Pressing control+f when on a page brings up a dialog in which you can type some text to find. Pressing enter will then search for this text and place the virtualBuffer cursor on this line. Pressing f3 will also search for the next occurance of the text.
<LI>When speak typed characters is turned on, more characters should be now spoken. Technically, now ascii characters from 32 to 255 can now be spoken.
<LI>Renamed some control types for better readability. Editable text is now edit, outline is now tree view and push button is now button.
<LI>When arrowing around list items in a list, or tree view items in a tree view, the control type (list item, tree view item) is no longer spoken, to speed up navigation.
<LI>Has Popup (to indicate that a menu has a submenu) is now spoken as submenu.
<LI>Where some language use control and alt (or altGR) to enter a special character, NVDA now will speak these characters when speak typed characters is on.
<LI>Fixed some problems with reviewing static text controls.
<LI>Added Translation for Traditional Chinese, thanks to Coscell Kao.
<LI>Re-structured an important part of the NVDA code, which should now fix many issues with NVDA's user interface (including settings dialogs).
<LI>Added Sapi4 support to NVDA. Currently there are two sapi4 drivers, one based on code contributed by Serotek Corporation, and one using the ActiveVoice.ActiveVoice com Interface. Both these drivers have issues, see which one works best for you.
<LI>Now when trying to run a new copy of NVDA while an older copy is still running will cause the new copy to just exit. This fixes a major problem where running multiple copies of NVDA makes your system very unusable.
<LI>Renamed the title of the NVDA user interface from NVDA Interface to NVDA. 
<LI>Fixed a bug in Outlook Express where pressing backspace at the start of an editable message would cause an error.
<LI>Added patch from Rui Batista that adds a script to report the current battery status on laptops (insert+shift+b).
<LI>Added a synth driver called Silence. This is a synth driver that does not speak anything, allowing NVDA to stay completely silent at all times. Eventually this could be used along with Braille support, when we have it.
<LI>Added capitalPitchChange setting for synthesizers thanks to J.J. Meddaugh
<LI>Added patch from J.J. Meddaugh that makes the toggle report objects under mouse script more like the other toggle scripts (saying on/off rather than changing the whole statement).
<LI>Added spanish translation (es) contributed by Juan C. buo.
<LI>Added Hungarian language file from Tamas Gczy.
<LI>Added Portuguese language file from Rui Batista.
<LI>Changing the voice in the voice settings dialog now sets the rate, pitch and volume sliders to the new values according to the synthesizer, rather than forcing the synthesizer to be set to the old values. This fixes issues where a synth like eloquence or viavoice seems to speek at a much faster rate than all other synths.
<LI>Fixed a bug where either speech would stop, or NVDA would entirely crash, when in a Dos console window.
<LI>If support for a particular language exists, NVDA now automatically can show its interface and speak its messages in the language Windows is set to. A particular language can still be chosen manualy from the user interface settings dialog as well.
<LI>Added script 'toggleReportDynamicContentChanges' (insert+5). This toggles whether new text, or other dynamic changes should be automatically announced. So far this only works in Dos Console Windows.
<LI>Added script 'toggleCaretMovesReviewCursor' (insert+6). This toggles whether the review cursor should be automatically repositioned when the system caret moves. This is useful in Dos console windows when trying to read information as the screen is updating.
<LI>Added script 'toggleFocusMovesNavigatorObject' (insert+7). This toggles whether the navigator object is repositioned on the object with focus as it changes.
<LI>Added some documentation translated in to various languages. So far there is French, Spannish and Finish.
<LI>Removed some developer documentation from the binary distribution of NVDA, it is only now in the source version.
<LI>Fixed a possible bug in Windows Live Messanger and MSN Messenger where arrowing up and down the contact list would cause errors.
<LI>New messages are now automatically spoken when in a conversation using Windows Live Messenger. (only works for English versions so far)
<LI>The history window in a Windows Live Messenger conversation can now be read by using the arrow keys. (Only works for English versions so far) 
<LI>Added script 'passNextKeyThrough' (insert+f2). Press this key, and then the next key pressed will be passed straight through to Windows. This is useful if you have to press a certain key in an application but NVDA uses that key for something else.
<LI>NVDA no longer freezes up for more than a minute when opening very large documents in MS Word.
<LI>Fixed a bug where moving out of a table in MS Word, and then moving back in, caused the current row/column numbers not to be spoken if moving back in to exactly the same cell.
<LI>When starting NVDA with a synthesizer that doesn't exist, or is not working, the sapi5 synth will try and be loaded in stead, or if sapi5 isn't working, then speech will be set to silence.
<LI>Increasing and decreasing rate scripts can no longer take the rate above 100 or below 0.
<LI>If there is an error with a language when choosing it in the User Interface Settings dialog, a message box will alert the user to the fact.
<LI>NVDA now asks if it should save configuration and restart if the user has just changed the language in the User Interface Settings Dialog. NVDA must be restarted for the language change to fully take effect.
<LI>If a synthesizer can not be loaded, when choosing it from the synthesizer dialog, a message box alerts the user to the fact.
<LI>When loading a synthesizer for the first time, NVDA lets the synthesizer choose the most suitable voice, rate and pitch parameters, rather than forcing it to defaults it thinks are ok. This fixes a problem where Eloquence and Viavoice sapi4 synths start speaking way too fast for the first time.
