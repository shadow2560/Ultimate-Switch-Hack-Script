<title>Add-on Updater 23.06.1</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Add-on Updater</h1>
<ul>
<li>Author: Joseph Lee, Luke Davis</li>
<li>Download <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/addonStore/legacy?file=addonUpdater">stable version</a></li>
<li>NVDA compatibility: 2023.1 and later</li>
</ul>
<p>This add-on brings NVDA Core issue 3208 to life: ability to check for, download, and apply add-on updates.</p>
<p>To check for updates after installing this add-on, go to NVDA menu/Tools/Check for add-on updates (if NVDA did notice updates, the menu item will say "Review add-on updates" followed by update count). If updates are available, a list of add-on updates will be shown, with each entry consisting of description, current version, and the new version. Select Update, and NVDA will download and apply updates in sequence, with a prompt to restart your NVDA shown afterwards.</p>
<p>The following add-ons provide built-in update feature and thus updates will not be checked via this add-on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Braille Extender</li>
<li>Tienda NVDA (Spanish NVDA Community Store)</li>
</ul>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTES:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a proof of concept add-on. Once the <a href="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/3208">relevant feature is included in NVDA</a> in the form of <a href="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/pull/13985">an add-on store</a>, this add-on will be discontinued.</li>
<li>This add-on is not intended to be used in secure screens. If you have add-ons installed in the secure screen, even if you copy Add-on Updater to secure screen mode, Add-on Updater will not work.</li>
<li>If the new add-on updates specify a compatibility range (minimum and last tested NVDA versions) and if the NVDA version you are running does not fall within the compatibility range according to NVDA, add-on updating will not proceed.</li>
<li>Not all add-ons come with development releases. If you are not getting updates after choosing to install development versions of an add-on, switch to stable channel for affected add-ons.</li>
<li>On some systems (particularly computers joined to a corporate domain), add-on update check functionality may not work properly, therefore add-on updates must be downloaded manually.</li>
<li>Some features require NVDA to be installed on the computer, ideally on a computer running Windows 10 or later.</li>
<li>Some add-on releases include SHA256 hash values for checking add-on package integrity, and if the hash value does not match, add-on updating will fail.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Add-on settings</h2>
<p>You can configure Add-on Updater settings from NVDA Settings screen (NVDA menu, Preferences, Settings) under Add-on Updater category. Add-on settings are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically check for add-on updates: if checked, NVDA will check for add-on updates once a day. Automatic update checks is enabled on Windows client systems and disabled on server systems.</li>
<li>Add-on update notification (Windows 10 and later): you can choose to receive update notification as a dialog or a toast. On Windows releases earlier than 10 and on server systems, or running portable copy of NVDA, update notification will be shown as a dialog.</li>
<li>Update add-ons in the background (Windows 10 and later and update notification is set to toast): if checked, Add-on Updater will apply updates in the background. A toast will appear informing you that add-on updates are being downloaded and installed, followed by another message announcing update results. Same limitations as add-on update notification setting and toast must be selected from the above option in order for background updates to work.</li>
<li>Do not update add-ons: you can choose add-ons that should not be updated.</li>
<li>Prefer development releases: any add-ons checked in this list will receive development (prerelease) releases.</li>
<li>Development release channel (selected add-on must be checked from prefer development releases): allows selecting development updates coming from either dev or beta channel.</li>
<li>Add-on update source: you can choose where to get updates from. Currently Add-on Updater supports downloading updates from the sources listed below. A confirmation message will be shown after changing update source.</li>
</ul>
<p>The available add-on update sources are:</p>
<ul>
<li>NV Access add-on store (default)</li>
<li>Community add-ons website</li>
<li>Spanish community add-ons catalog</li>
<li>Catalogs maintained by NVDA communities in China and Taiwan</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 23.06</h2>
<ul>
<li>NVDA 2023.1 or later is required.</li>
<li>Changed default add-on update source from community add-ons website to NV Access add-on store.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 23.05</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add-on update channel will be displayed when reviewing available add-on updates.</li>
<li>NVDA will present a message about add-on store if using NVDA releases with add-on store included.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 23.04</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added development update channel setting to let users of development add-ons choose between dev and beta update channels. This option is shown if the selected add-on from prefer development releases list is checked.</li>
<li>NV Access add-on store is broadly available as an update source from Add-on Updater.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 23.03</h2>
<ul>
<li>Due to changes made to the website used by some update sources, this must be installed manually.</li>
<li>Added NV Access add-on store as an experimental add-on update source.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 23.02</h2>
<ul>
<li>NVDA 2022.4 or later is required.</li>
<li>NVDA will no longer offer what appears to be older add-on updates for most add-ons after checking for add-on updates. This applies to add-ons with version text of the form number.number.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 23.01</h2>
<ul>
<li>NVDA will check minimum Windows version for add-on updates if update source is set to NVDA community add-ons website.</li>
<li>Improved performance when downloading many ad-on updates at once. As a result, the order of add-on downloads shown in download progress dialog will be random.</li>
<li>Parts of the add-on now use Python's concurrent.futures module to improve performance, specifically update check and download processes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 22.11</h2>
<ul>
<li>NVDA 2022.3 or later is required.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 22.10</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Version 22.09</h2>
<ul>
<li>NVDA 2022.2 or later is required.</li>
<li>NVDA will check SHA256 hash values while downloading add-on updates if the add-on update source includes hash values for add-on packages. If hash value is invalid, add-on updating will fail.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 22.08</h2>
<ul>
<li>Significant internal code reorganization and rewrites.</li>
<li>On Windows Server systems, automatic add-on update check feature is disabled by default (affects new installations).</li>
<li>Added ability to select different add-on update sources. Add-on Updater can check for updates hosted on community add-ons website (addons.nvda-project.org) or Spanish community add-ons catalog (nvda.es). A new combo box was added in add-on settings panel to select add-on update source.</li>
<li>On Windows 10 and later, it is possible to let Add-on Updater check for, download, and install add-on updates in the background provided that NVDA is actually installed and ad-on update notification is set to toast.</li>
<li>Redesigned add-on update download and install experience for multiple add-on updates, including use of a single dialog to show download progress for all add-ons and updating add-ons after downloading all of them.</li>
<li>If NVDA is set to announce update notifications as toasts, "check for add-on updates" menu item will become "review add-on updates" when updates become available, with the new name including add-on update count.</li>
<li>In NVDA 2022.1 and later, Add-on Updater can process command-line switches for this add-on (currently none).</li>
<li>In add-on updates dialog, add-ons disabled by the user are unchecked by default, and a confirmation message will be shown checking disabled add-ons and attempting to update them as doing so will enable them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 22.07</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Version 21.07</h2>
<ul>
<li>On Windows 10 and later, a toast notification will be shown when add-on updates are available. Note that you cannot click this notification - you must open NVDA menu/Tools/Check for add-on updates to review updates.</li>
<li>When legacy add-ons dialog is shown at startup, you can now review legacy add-ons and reasons just like add-on updates.</li>
<li>Improved add-on update check internals, including use of add-on metadata collection provided by the community to validate add-on compatibility. Among other things, this eliminates add-on releases for adding update checks for new add-ons.</li>
