<h2>Launch homebrews by taking advantage of the 3 GB of RAM</h2>
&nbsp;
<p>
To use some homebrews as Pplay, it is recommended to launch the homebrews menu using the switch's 3GB ram. In general, it is better to use this method to launch homebrews. To do this, the method of launching the homebrew menu with ram varies according to the payload used:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Under SX OS it is necessary to maintain "R" by launching a game under SX OS. If it is via an XCI for this method to work, it must first be mounted.</li>
<li>Under the latest versions of Atmosphere, as for SX OS, you must keep the "R" button pressed by launching a game installed on the console (this could be configured in the "atmosphere\config\override_config.ini" file). Moreover, to launch the Homebrew Menu from the album, it is also necessary to maintain "R" by launching it.
<br/>
Info: The "R" button must be held after selecting the account that the game will launch (if the game works this way because some games proceed differently in which case the "R" button must be held when clicking on the game icon). So the best thing to do is to hold down the "R" button just before clicking on the game icon and release it once the Homebrew Menu is launched.</li>
<li>For ReiNX, you need to download <a target="_new" href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/homebrew-menu-loader-legal-nsp.518433/">the NSP of the HBMenu</a> (included during the sd preparation into the folder "nsp" on the SD) and then install it with Goldleaf or any other homebrew to install NSP. Once this is done, you will have access to the Homebrew Menu directly via the Switch's game icons and the 3 GB of RAM will be used.
<br/>
Note: This method is compatible with all CFWs but for SX OS it is useless in my opinion and for Atmosphere it is possible to do otherwise so install this NSP must be done if no alternative method suits you.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2>The configurations that can be launched via Hekate</h2>
&nbsp;
<p>
With the pack containing Atmosphere Hekate is also automatically set up and it contains different configurations to run the CFW. Here are some explanations about these configurations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Atmosphere_emunand: Allows you to run Atmosphere on the emunand without sig_patches. If no emunand has been configured then an error will be displayed.</li>
<li>Atmosphere_emunand+SigPatches: Same as the previous configuration but sig_patches are used, this is the configuration to launch if an emunand is configured.</li>
<li>Atmosphere_no_emunand: Runs Atmosphere on the sysnand without sig_patches.</li>
<li>Atmosphere_no_emunand+SigPatches: Same as the previous configuration but sig_patches are used, this is the configuration to run if no emunand is configured.</li>
<li>Stock: Starts the console on the sysnand without CFW, without sig_patches.</li>
<li>Stock+nocmac: Same as the previous configuration but the "nocmac" patches are used, these patches can be used until firmware 6.1.0. This configuration is very specific and is only used when unbricking the console.</li>
<li>Atmosphere_emunand+nocmac: Launches Atmosphere on the emunand with the "nocmac" patches, this configuration can be used when unbricking the emunand.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2>Optional homebrews</h2>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>AIO-switch-updater: An homebrew witch could update the CFWs and sig_patches, launch payloads and change the joycon's colors.</li>
<li>appstore: Install, update or delete homebrews from the Switch simply.</li>
<li>AtmoXL-Titel-Installer: An other content installer based on Awoo-installer.</li>
<li>Avatool: Change the image of an avatar using the 255X255 images placed in the "avatar" folder at the root of the SD.</li>
<li>Awoo-Installer: A NSP/NSZ/XCI/XCZ installer based on Adube's Tinfoil (doesn't work on SX OS).</li>
<li>Battery_desync_fix_nx: Can be use to fix some problems with the battery.  Please read <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/CTCaer/battery_desync_fix_nx">the readme of the project</a> to understand how to use it.</li>
<li>BiggestDump: Allows you to dump the current firmware of the console or the one waiting for installation. This can be useful used in conjunction with ChoiDuJour-NX to install the EXFAT driver quite simply.</li>
<li>Checkpoint: Allows you to save/restore game backups.</li>
<li>ChoiDuJourNX: Update the console without burning Efuses (never launch an update with the official bootloader once installed because the Efuses will be burned) or downgrade the console (same remark as for the update except that if the firmware is launched by the official bootloader and the number of Efuses does not match the console will not launch the firmware, you must go through ReiNX or Hekate or others).</li>
<li>Cling-Wrap: Allows to use Tinfoil with Hekate, it renames the "bootloader" folder or puts it back in place (the overlay doing the same thing is also copied by my script).</li>
<li>DBI: A content installer (NSP or XCI or etc...), particularly usful with the NSC_Builder installation method.</li>
<li>Delve: A simple terminal gopher client.</li>
<li>EbookViewerNX: Read some ebooks formats.</li>

<li>Homebrew_details: A good replacement for Homebrew Menu.</li>
<li>incognito : Allows you to delete the identification data from the console to avoid banning it from the console. Be careful, once this is done it will no longer be possible to use Nintendo's online services unless you restore the PRODINFO partition of the console so keep a backup of this partition, either by uploading it via Hekate or NxNandManager or by keeping the backup that will be made when using this homebrew. This partition being encrypted with the Bis Keys of the console, the PRODINFO of one console cannot be exchanged with another PRODINFO of another console.</li>

<li>JKSV: Another backup manager.</li>
<li>Joycon-Toolbox: Change joycons' leds color.</li>

<li>Linkalho : Allows you to link a Nintendo account unofficially but without deleting all your users and saves like Linkuser.</li>
<li>LinkUser: Same as Linkalho but delete all the game backup (use a backup manager like JKSV or DBI to save them); prefer to use Linkalho witch is better.</li>
<li>Lockpick: Allows you to dump the different keys used by Hactool and other derivatives. Be careful, do not share the file "keys.txt" (or "prod.keys") obtained thanks to this homebrew because it contains console-specific keys such as tsec_key for example. This homebrew also allows you to dumper the title keys installed on the console.</li>
