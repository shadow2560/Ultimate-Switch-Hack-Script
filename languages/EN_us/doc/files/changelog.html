</ul>
<h2>V3.99.118</h2>

<li>Bug fixes in the python script to test the different keys of a key file. Still in this script, the verification is no longer done in MD5 but in SHA256.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.99.117</h2>
<ul>
<li>For requesting information on a nand file or for activating/deactivating auto-RCM on a BOOT0 partition, the script now asks if things should be done in debug mode or not for NXNandManager, so that problems can be identified more quickly if necessary.
</ul>
<h2>V3.99.116</h2>
<ul>
<li>The function to apply Incognito to a split nand has been temporarily blocked because it does not work with the current version of NXNandManager. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.99.115</h2>
<ul>
<li>Corrected a bug that prevented the Incognito mode of NXNandManager from working properly. </li>
<li>Update NXNandManager to the Master version of the Github, compiled by myself. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.99.114</h2>
<ul>
<li> Updating NXNandManager to version 2.0.</li>
<li>Added function to delete identification information (as Incognito does) in the Nand Toolbox, function performed with NXNandManager again.</li>
<li>NXNandManager work information is shown when auto-RCM is enabled/disabled and application settings can be defined during this process. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.99.113</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bug fixes in the NSC_Builder launch script. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.99.112</h2>
<ul>
<li>Info displays on part of the nand in the Nand Toolbox are now translated into French and can also be translated into the other languages of the script. </li>
<The specific functionality to know the firmware and other information of the rawnand via FVI has been removed because it now duplicates the display of additional information from NXNandManager. In fact, the update manager will delete the files associated with this feature when updating the Nand Toolbox if they exist. </li>
<li>Update NXNandManager to the Master version of the Github, compiled by myself. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.99.111</h2>
<ul>
<Added the possibility to save a nand to encrypt directly on a physical device if the dump to restore is all the rawnand, this feature is added in the part allowing to encrypt the nand or a partition of it in the Nand Toolbox. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.99.110</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update NXNandManager to the Master version of the Github, compiled by myself. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.99.109</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update of NXNandManager which, moreover, becomes compatible with X86 systems again, thanks to @eliboa for its work on this excellent software and on this point all the more thanks to him because it was not easy to find a solution. With this update, it is now possible to encrypt/decrypt all the rawnand at once. Bugs have also been fixed. </li>
<li>The file names of the decrypted partitions no longer contain the mention "_decrypted" after the partition name because this causes compatibility concerns with the detection made by NXNandManager. In fact, encrypted partition files will not have the extension".bin" while the names of decrypted partition files will have the extension".bin", as set by default in HacDiskMount. In fact, the best way to classify dumps is to put each file from the same dump in a folder with the console's serial number or a clear identification of the console in a separate folder. This is probably only a temporary fix, other approaches will probably be considered in the future. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.99.108.108</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deletion of the old directory used by SX Installer if it exists if the copy of SX OS is chosen during the preparation of an SD. </li>

</ul>
<h2>V3.99.106</h2>
<ul>
<li>Addition of information on the new Atmosphere parameters in the information of a profile or when preparing the SD. Still in this moment of information display, if an element of the Atmosphere configuration is not set in the profile, the value that will be used will be indicated. </li>
<li>Correct a bug if some default settings were not set in the general profiles, if Atmosphere was selected and if its configuration was manually done. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.99.105</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adding new features in the Nand Toolbox (Alpha test features), thanks to the new version of NXNandManager in development it is optionally possible to have more information on a nand dump thanks to the Bis keys to provide via a dump file of these made with Lockpick-RCM or Biskeydump. Two new features have been added, the encryption and decryption of the rawnand or a partition of it, for these features a file containing the Bis keys is required. It should be noted that for the time being, the encryption/decryption of a "rawnand.bin" is impossible but on the other hand we can encrypt/decrypt the partitions of this file (the encryption/decryption of the complete rawnand will be added in a future version of NXNandManager) and, importantly, NXNandManager is only compatible with systems in X64 version (64 bits) because for the moment I can't compile NXNandManager into X86 (32 bits), if I can update it. </li>
<li>Added the setting of the Atmosphere parameters "applet_heap_size" and "applet_heap_reservation_size" in the manual configuration of it. The various general profiles have also been updated to include these additions. </li>
<When preparing an SD and if the manual configuration of Atmosphere is enabled in a personal general profile, the parameters not set in the profile will have a default value (the default value is the one found in the official releases of Atmosphere), this allows to continue using the old personal general profiles not updated even if new things have been added in the meantime.</li>
<li>Display bug fixes in different scripts. </li>
<li> Update of the start payload of Atmosphere Fusee-primary in version 0.9.3.</li>
<li> Updating CFWs/modules/homebrews/usful_payloads packs in version 231.</li>

<ul>
<li>The script for preparing an update via ChoiDuJourNX now allows, in addition to the other functions already present, to only download the firmware file. The operation of this script has also been modified a little so that the script only ends if the user decides to, for the rest of the time the script will return to its main action. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.99.103</h2>
<ul>
<li> Updating Goldtree to version 3.99.103.</li>

<li>Creation of new variables in the language configuration file to change the letters to be used for the choices "yes", "no", "always" and "never For the moment, variables are only used for display purposes, their processing is not yet implemented. </li>
<li>Various updates to the displayed messages. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.99.98</h2>
<ul>
<li>The key verification script has been made fully compatible with multi-languages as well as the script for creating a firmware package via ChoiDuJour. However, the python script used remains in French but this is not visible in the associated batch scripts. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.99.97</h2>

</ul>
<h2>V3.99.90</h2>
<ul>
<li>Now, the update manager will continue the mandatory processing alone without asking the user if an update requires one or more restarts or if an error occurred during the update of an item. Note that this only applies to the essential elements of the script (elements of the "base" version or language to be initialized), this behavior stops as soon as they are updated. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.99.89</h2>
<ul>
<li>Additional corrections on the update manager and on the script updating it. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.99.88</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bug fix in the script to update the update manager, normally it should no longer display errors if the update is done via a script version between 3.00.00 and 3.99.88. Some messages have also been changed for the occasion. </li>

<ul>
<li> Updating CFWs/modules/homebrews/usful_payloads packs in version 220.</li>
<li>Special instructions for Tinfoil were put back in place in the copy of homebrews during the preparation of an SD, the module was put back in place. </li>

</ul>
<h2>V3.00.35</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wide speed increase for extracting files from the nand dump of a partition file for the emunand and fixing bugs in it. </li>
<li>Wide increase in the processing speed of creating a file allowing the creation of a partition for the emunand, the old method was really too long so I decide to sacrifice the checks to gain processing speed. </li>
<Addition of the parameter managing the title of the emunand in the management of emunand profiles as well as in the preparation of an SD. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.34</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update of NSC_Builder, still in 0.87C but the translation has been modified. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.33</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update the script to prepare an SD to stick to the latest version of Tinfoil which no longer includes the special module that was present in the previous version. </li>

<li>Added saving of emummc profiles in the backup function. By the way, some bugs have been fixed in this script. </li>
<li> Updating CFWs/modules/homebrews/usful_payloads packs in version 216.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.31</h2>
<ul>
<li>Creation of a new feature to configure emummc profiles for Atmosphere that can be used in the preparation of an SD. In fact, the old general profiles are no longer valid because the way of managing the copy of elements on the SD has completely changed at this level. The default general profiles have been updated to include this new feature and the update manager also takes it into account. Finally, it is possible to find this feature when preparing an SD if Atmosphere is chosen to be copied and it can also be found in the parameters menu. </li>
<li>Added a default profile for the Atmosphere emummc that allows to have a configuration that can boot on an emunand via partition created by SXOS and to completely share this emunand between the two CFWs. </li>
<li>Corrected a bug in the preparation of an SD that did not correctly copy the "seven" directory and its necessary files when copying SX OS.</li>
<In the update manager, the documentation is now updated apart from the general content of the script because it is updated with each version of the script and checking all updates of the main elements takes too long, there will be faster as well. A slight bug has also been fixed. </li>
<li>Corrected a bug in the toolbox reset, a tool was missing in the file allowing this restoration. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.30</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added the possibility to use PegaScape in its official version (the one of the Atlas team accessible via their server) when preparing the SD of this script, the chosen payload and the file "hbl.nsp" will be copied to the folder "atmosphere" and named correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.29</h2>
<ul>
<li>Revision of the logic of the beginning of the update manager, many unnecessary processes in some situations are no longer performed, considerably accelerating the script. This modification will impact especially those who do not make automatic updates, whether via the permanent or temporary choice, they will save time to launch the different scripts. For the others, the processing time will remain essentially the same. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.28</h2>
<ul>
<li> Updating CFWs/modules/homebrews/usful_payloads packs in version 215.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.27</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rewriting some Nand Toolbox scripts to change the method of checking the available space on the disk on which the files are written, this new method is much easier to understand in terms of code. </li>
<li>Corrected a major bug in the script to extract the different parts of the nand of an emunand file via partition, BOOT1 was not correctly checked for its size once the process was completed. Another important bug fixed, the file could not be selected, so it did not allow to execute the script. Finally, an error made BOOT1 could not be extracted due to an error in the command line, this has also been fixed. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.26</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added taking into account the first 1024 bytes allowing to create an emunand partition compatible with SX OS in the script allowing to generate this type of file. The verification of this type of created files has also been added to the script to extract the different parts of a nand of this type of file, thus adding an additional verification. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.25</h2>
<ul>
<li>Slight modification of the script to use Memloader to mount the different partitions of the Switch to make the user experience easier. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.24</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added a new feature to gather game files split into a single file, which can be found in the "other functions" menu of the script. However, since I didn't have any split games at hand, I couldn't test this feature so feedback is welcome. </li>
<li>Update the update manager to modify a little the method of updating the general elements of the script, this probably allowing to prevent some possible bugs.</li>
<li>Bug fixes in the Nand Toolbox script that could prevent the script from working properly. </li>
<li>Corrected a bug in the script to create an emunand file for use with the emunand partition mode, the script could not run if the dump of the nand had been done via Hekate. </li>
<li>Corrected a bug preventing XCI-Cutter from running properly in the XCI/NSP cutting script. </li>
<li> Updating CFWs/modules/homebrews/usful_payloads packs in version 214.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.23</h2>
<ul>
<li>Modification of the functionality allowing to dump the nand via NXNandManager, now if an existing dump type identical to the attempted dump type is found in the specified output folder and the user confirms the choice to continue, this will be deleted just after the choice to continue if the user accepts, this has been implemented to prevent NXNandManager from thinking that a dump is being restored, which would prevent it from doing the MD5 verification if desired by the user. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.22</h2>
<ul>
<li> Updating NSC_Builder to version 0.87C.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.21</h2>
<ul>
<Change in the method of copying Retro Reloaded specific elements (part concerning Sept) for Atmosphere and ReiNX CFWs, allowing to reduce the size of the packs a little by removing files that were duplicates.</li>
<li> Updating CFWs/modules/homebrews/usful_payloads packs in version 213.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.20</h2>
<ul>
<li> Update of the start payload of Atmosphere, Fusee-primary.</li>
<li> Updating CFWs/modules/homebrews/usful_payloads packs in version 212.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.19</h2>
<ul>
<li>Correction of a spelling error in the occasional functions menu. </li>
<Added the indication of the maximum possible firmware to be created with ChoiDuJour in the script using it and the function is no longer launched in automatic preparation if the selected firmware is greater than 6.1.0.
<li> Update of Hekate payload to 5.0.1.</li>
<li> Updating CFWs/modules/homebrews/usful_payloads packs in version 211.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.18</h2>
<ul>
<li>Creation of a script using Renxpack to create an NSP compatible with the lowest possible firmware of the Switch. This new function is integrated into the update manager and can be found in the "other functions" menu. </li>
<li>Modification of the script using 4NXCI to be compatible with the last parameters of the application. </li>
<li> Documentation update. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.17</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adding a version for the general elements of the script. This allows you to update them as soon as an update is attempted without extending the update time too much. </li>
<In the update manager, the version of the general elements of the script is checked each time the user tries to update an element and the general elements are updated if necessary, allowing better control of bugs that may occur if these elements are not updated. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.16</h2>
<ul>
<li>Corrected a bug in the update manager that prevented a correct update of the preparation of an SD in some cases.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.15</h2>
<ul>
<li> Updating CFWs/modules/homebrews/usful_payloads packs in version 210.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.14</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update documentation to include application installation on Android via USB debug mode in the feature list. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.13</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added functionality to install Android applications via USB debug mode, for the moment version 3.1 of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MenosGrante/Rekado">Rekado</a> is included. This function can be found in the "other functions" menu of the script. </li>
<li> Update the update manager to include the new functionality presented above. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.12</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update of NSC_Builder in version 0.87B translated by @fabriceunko from Logic-sunrise, thanks to him. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.11</h2>
<ul>
<li>Slight modification in the download/preparation script of a firmware for ChoiDuJour/ChoiDuJourNX avoiding the user to press a key when he chooses to return to the previous menu at the beginning of the script. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.10</h2>
<ul>
<li>The automatic restart has been restored when the update manager was updated. </li>
<An additional check is now performed at the very beginning of the script, if no internet connection is available at that time, the script is immediately stopped and goes on, sparing some unnecessary processing in this kind of case.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.09</h2>
<ul>
<When the update manager updates itself, the script will be closed and will have to be restarted manually because the automatic restart of the script caused strange behaviors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.07</h2>
<ul>
<li>Correct many bugs in the update manager and in its updater, the elements used to prepare an SD are correctly downloaded and failed updates will resume correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.06</h2>
<ul>
<li>Launching a payload no longer generates a log file, I think this is useless in the end. </li>
<li>In the update manager, a function has been implemented to be able to delete any file(s)/folder(s) that would no longer be used in future versions. For the moment this function does not delete anything, it just displays the information message of the execution of it. </li>
<In the "About" script, a new update method has been implemented, it allows to redo all the updates of the script, this could be useful in some very specific cases.</li>
<li>Update of the launch payload from Atmosphere (Fusee-primary) to the master version of the Github, compiled by myself. </li>
<li>Modifying messages in the script running the PegaScape/PegaSwitch server. </li>
<li> Updating CFWs/modules/homebrews/usful_payloads packs in version 209.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.05</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update of the launch payload from Atmosphere (Fusee-primary) to the master version of the Github, compiled by myself. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.04</h2>
<ul>
<li>Return to the normal Hekate version. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.03</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update of the launch payload from Atmosphere (Fusee-primary) to the master version of the Github, compiled by myself. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.02</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update of Hekate by version 5.0.0.0-J of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Joonie86/hekate/releases/">this project</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.01</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added some messages in the update manager to better identify what is happening. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V3.00.00.00 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Implementation of an adaptive update manager that replaces the old one (the parameter of always or not checking updates will however be affected because it has not changed the verification method). Now, the script can update itself completely autonomously if some database files are present. In addition, this update system automatically installs a new feature when it is first launched. However, the concern with this new method is that if you want the script to always check for updates, the launch of scripts is longer because of these checks and scripts with a lot of dependencies will therefore take longer to launch in this case and if you choose not to make a final choice, the question of attempting an update will be asked each time you launch a feature via the main menus (general menu, occasional functions menu, other functions menu and parameters menu). That being said, you can also update all the features via the "About" function and choose never to check for updates automatically, so this way of working will hardly slow down the script. Another strong point, the elements to be updated now each have a specific version (basic set on this version of the script) and they will only be updated if there is one available so it greatly reduces download times. </li>
<li>Deletion of the version of the cheat pack that has become useless. </li>
<li> Documentation update. </li>
<li>Other changes I forgot to note.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.11.17 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>The script to launch PegaScape should restart correctly. </li>
<li>The parameter menu file has been renamed. </li>
<li>Adjustments for the new big feature that should be available soon. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.11.17</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some changes in the menus, the most important being that the forced update of the script is now in the "About" menu rather than on the main menu. </li>
<li>Some other changes preparing for the great novelty to come. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.11.16 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Modification of the HID-mitm_compagnon launch method. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.11.15</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update of the preparation of an SD to use the new configuration of the Atmosphere emunand 0.9.2, the old file will no longer work. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.11.14</h2>
<ul>
<li> Update of the Atmosphere startup payload in version 0.9.2.</li>
<li> Update of the Hekate payload to version 5.0.0.0.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.11.13 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Space removal in the startup script file name to simplify the process of future updates. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.11.12</h2>
<ul>
<li> Updating the script to prepare an SD for a new function to come. </li>
<li>Move the functionality to launch Linux (obsolete function) in the occasional functions menu and reorganize the menus accordingly. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.11.11 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Removal of an unnecessary file in the PegaScape/PegaSwitch package for Caffeine/Nereba.</li>
<li>Copy of the files required to launch the HBL via PegaScape/PegaSwitch. </li>
<li>Revision of the PegaScape/PegaSwitch scripts allowing to launch the HBL, the file "hbl.nsp" will no longer be searched in the "atmosphere" folder of the SD but rather in the "pegascape" folder, this seems more consistent to me. However, for practical reasons, the file will also be copied into the "atmosphere" folder of the SD by the SD preparation function of the PegaSwitch script in order to ensure compatibility with the official PegaScape portal of the Atlas team. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.11.10</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update PegaScape to the master version of Github. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.11.09 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li> Implementation of the PegaScape solution in addition to the PegaSwitch solution, the user will now have the choice to launch one or the other. </li>
<li>Move the Nereba script to the main menu and it will be indicated more clearly by explaining what can be done with it. The script is also renamed to "pegaswitch.bat" because ultimately it is the main program that is used by it. </li>
<li>Bug fixes in the PegaSwitch script and change of the file copy method on the SD.</li>
<In the Nand Toolbox, once an operation is completed, the program returns to the selection of the main actions rather than going back to the current action, this implicitly clarifies the operation and makes it much more consistent.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.11.08</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adding Fakenews-injector homebrew to homebrews copied by default to general profiles as well as to the profile containing all homebrews.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.11.07</h2>
<ul>
<Added suport for launching PegaSwitch in Webapplet mode, useful for firmware 1.0.0.0 with the Japanese version of Puyo Puyo Tetris or via the use of the Fake News entry point. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.11.06 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li> Updating the Nereba script so that the payload to launch is in the "nereba\nereba.bin" folder of the SD, I prefer this operation because it makes it independent of Atmosphere. For that, I recompiled Caffeine including this modification, the rest of the code has not changed at all. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.11.05 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>The script using the Nereba exploit has been updated to also use Caffeine to launch a payload for firmwares 4.1.0, see <a target="_blank" href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/caffeine-updated-to-suport-fw-4-1-0-works-on-patched-switches.541826/">this info</a> to understand a little better how it works. PegaSwitch has also been updated to suport all this. This feature has not been tested, you can give me feedback on whether it works or not on the subject dedicated to my script. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.11.04 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Start of the implementation of an element update management, not used by the script for the moment. </li>
<li> Updating the tree structure of some folders and updating scripts related to these changes. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.11.03</h2>
<ul>
<li> Updating NXNandManager to version 1.1.2.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.11.02</h2>
<ul>
<li>Firmware key suport 8.1.0 for the functionality of checking a key file. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.11.01</h2>
<ul>
<li>BiskeyDump update to version 9, now supports firmware 8.1.0.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.11.00</h2>
<ul>
<Suport for downloading and setting up on SD for ChoiDuJourNX firmware 8.1.0.</li>
<li> Update of NSC_Builder in version 0.86E translated into French. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.99 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>FVI update, detects firmware 8.1.0.</li>
<In the preparation of an SD, the special treatment for ReiNX modules has been removed because it is normally more necessary. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.98</h2>
<ul>
<In the SD preparation script, if the homebrew NXDumpTool is copied to the SD, the old GCDumpTool project is removed from the SD. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.97 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li> Updating the default profile configuration files used during the preparation of an SD to be compatible with the name change of the GCDumpTool project to NXDumpTool. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.96 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adaptation of the SD preparation script to the version of Sept integrated in Atmosphere 0.9.1.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.95</h2>
<ul>
<li>Creation of a function in the Nand Toolbox to extract the different parts of the nand from an emunand partition file, the script will probably be improved, especially in terms of error control, which seems sufficient to me but could probably be more complete. </li>
<li>Move the Nand Toolbox to the main menu of the script because this feature starts, and will become more and more important. </li>
<li>Corrected a bug in the configuration script of the Snes Classic Edition emulator. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.94</h2>
<ul>
<li>The way to detect the number of parts of a rawnand split via Hekate in the script to join the dump of a nand as well as in the script to create a emunand file to use with a partition has been significantly optimized and is much more flexible</li>
<li>Corrected an incorrect loop when renaming files for use as an Atmosphere emunand in a rawnand decoupling script, this error had little impact on the user because it worked as it was but it was executed once too often. Still in this script and still if the split dump files are renamed for the Atmosphere emunand, the files are now moved to a "eMMC" folder created in the output folder and the archive attribute is applied to this folder "eMMC". </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.93</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add an action to make a donation to me in the main menu. </li>
<li>Added a feature in the Nand Toolbox that allows to Create a file from a complete dump of the nand allowing to then prepare the emunand on a dedicated partition of the SD.</li>
<Update of the preparation of an SD as well as the preparation of the general profiles to take into account the configuration of the Atmosphere emunand, only accessible by configuring the CFW manually. The default general profiles have also been updated to take these changes into account, emunand is disabled for them. </li>
<li>Update of the nand split script, it now allows to name the correct files for the Atmosphere Emunand if you want and it also allows to define more freely the number of parts you want (from 8 to 64 parts). </li>
<li>Corrected a major bug in the script allowing to join parts of a split nand that prevented the script from starting copying, now the script should work correctly. </li>
<li>Update Hactool to the latest master version of the Github, compiled by myself. </li>
<li>Preparation of some GNU tools to be able to analyze or write directly to the different physical disks/partitions, this will be useful to update the script to prepare/run Linux as well as to prepare an emunand on a partition of the SD.</li>
<li> Documentation update. </li>
<li>Some other bugs fixed. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.92</h2>

</ul>
<h2>V2.10.90</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bug fixes for Nes Classic Edition and Snes Classic Edition configuration scripts. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.89</h2>
<ul>
<Adding two scripts to configure the Nes Classic Edition and Snes Classic Edition emulators, these scripts are available in the other functions or when preparing an SD if the emulator is copied and has never been configured. Thanks to @markus95 from Logic-sunrise for the basis of these scripts. </li>
<Adding the Nes Classic Edition and Snes Classic Edition emulators to the profile of all emulators copied during the preparation of an SD.</li>
<li> Documentation update for credits, new features and known bugs. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.88</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update of NSC_Builder in version 0.86C translated into French by @fabriceunko from Logic-sunrise and slightly corrected by myself, there must still be some mistakes because I haven't checked everything. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.87</h2>
<ul>
<li> SSNC update to version 1.0.</li>
<li> Updating NSC_Builder to version 0.86C.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.86 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Changes in the preparation of an SD to match the modifications of DZ Tinfoil and Lithium 1.61 added in the 180.</li> packs
<li>Hekate has been replaced by the version on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Joonie86/hekate/releases/">this fork of Hekate</a> which is compatible with DZ Tinfoil and Lithium. Attention, please read the pack changelog for version 180 as it contains information about the new features of this new version of Hekate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.85</h2>
<ul>
<li> Updating NSC_Builder to version 0.86B.</li>
<In the Nand Toolbox, the proposal to choose work on specific partitions during the nand restore/backup procedures is now only made if necessary. </li>
<li>Update MD5 of the different keys for the verification script of a Switch key file, now the verified keys are those obtained with Lockpick-RCM and the verifiable keys go up to the firmware 8.0.1.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.84</h2>
<ul>
<li>Corrected a major bug in the Nand Toolbox, now it is possible to work on a physical drive for dump or restore via NXNandManager again. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.83</h2>
<ul>
<li>Corrected a major bug when preparing firmware on the SD, now the homebrew ChoiDuJourNX will be correctly copied.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.82</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved the firmware info functionality of a nand dump, now the results are displayed in French.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.81</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adding a new feature to the Nand Toolbox, now it is possible to check the firmware on which a nand dump is located as well as the status of the EXFAT driver if we also have the Bis Keys of the console associated with the dump, thanks to the project <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/shchmue/FVI">FVI</a> on which this feature is based.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.80</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some minor changes in the menus regarding their display and the anticipation of possible bugs. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.79</h2>
<ul>
<Fixed a major bug that prevented the saving of general profiles when creating or modifying them.
<In the SX OS package, the main files of Sept are now copied because I consider that these files have become essential for many situations.
<Add two new default general profiles when preparing an SD, one to copy only Atmosphere and the other to copy only SX OS (each with recommended homebrews and emulators as well as cheats, cheats are not enabled by default in Atmosphere configuration files).</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.78</h2>
<ul>
<li>Also some aesthetic corrections. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.77</h2>
<ul>
<Fixed a bug that caused the script version not to be detected correctly when the script was launched as administrator, leading to bugs like the update of the script which always indicated an update even if in the last version. </li>
<li>Menus are refreshed each time they are loaded or they load something, allowing a better reading. </li>
<li>The main menus have titles that now make it easier to identify them. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.76</h2>
<ul>
<When updating packs via the script, the updated payload files in the packs will also be copied to the "Payloads" folder to list the payloads to be launched; this action will only take place if the update of the packs has been successfully completed. This way, if only one CFW has been updated in the packs, it will no longer be necessary to download the entire script to be able to run the updated payload, this will be done on its own by updating only the packs. This modification is an advantage for the user who has a little less downloads to do and it is also an advantage for me who will no longer have to deal with this kind of update in two different places, especially in terms of changelogs. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.75</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update of the launch payload from Atmosphere "Fusee Primary" to version 0.8.10 of Atmosphere. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.74</h2>
<ul>
<In the preparation of an SD, the recommended general profile no longer contains modules for Atmosphere nor cheats for Atmosphere and SX OS, now this configuration is very basic to avoid bugs related to some modules and will be a good test profile for a console that will have boot problems.</li>
<li>Update Lockpick_RCM payload to the latest Master version of the Github, compiled by myself. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.73</h2>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2>V2.10.69</h2>
<ul>
<li>The reset script has been a little reworked, some additional files are now deleted (profiles, mega configured account, downloaded firmware files, keys and other files/folders that may have been created during some scripts).</li>
<li>Added the possibility to consult the latest changelogs (general and packs) via the "About" page. </li>
<li>Change of the moment when the pack and cheat pack versions are detected, now this is done as soon as the script is launched. This fixes the problem that there was in the "About" page which did not display this information correctly in most cases.

This script is located in the menu of the other functions of the main menu. </li>
<li>Modification of the script launching the Switch-Lan-Play personal server and important changes in the folder tree used by it. </li>
<li> Updating packs to version 165.</li>
<li> Documentation and readme update. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.66</h2>
<ul>
<li>Usually, all modules should work with ReiNX, which was not the case before. </li>
<li>Removal of some useless files in module folders (not managed by the script but this being said these files should not be annoying on the SD, for information they are the files "git.gud" so if you want to delete them you will have to do it manually). </li>
<li> Updating XCI Explorer to version 1.4.7.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.64</h2>
<ul>
<li>Another bug fixed in the NSZip script, now it works completely. </li>

</ul>
<h2>V2.10.58</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adding a script to use NSZip, the script is accessible in the menu of the other features of the script. </li>
<li>Display of the current versions of the elements in the update script. </li>
<li>Creation of a "About" script that allows you to display some information about the script, for the moment it's very basic. </li>
<li> Documentation update. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.57</h2>
<ul>
<Added the possibility to manually configure some Atmosphere parameters during the preparation of an SD. If this is done during the preparation of a general profile, the settings will be saved in it. </li>

<ul>
<li> ReiNX payload update to version 2.2.</li>
</li>
<h2>V2.10.51</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved profile management (especially checking for the presence of a profile in the general profiles when deleting to add a significant error check) and various bug fixes in the general profile management, now it is much more what I want. </li>

<ul>
<li> Hekate update to version 4.10.1.</li>
<li>The Hekate "update.bin" file is now copied by the script to prepare an SD via the "payloads" folder of the packs, which allows to delete the file contained in the Atmosphere pack. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.49</h2>
<ul>
<li>Integration of a general profile management in the preparation of an SD, allowing to simplify it once the profiles have been created. The management of these profiles can be achieved through the preparation of an SD or through the general configuration menu. Finally, the created profiles will be backed up via the important file backup function and can therefore be restored. There are still improvements to be made for this feature (as well as for profile management in general) that I plan for future updates but this should be acceptable as it stands. </li>
<li>Creation of a default general profile for the preparation of an SD, it contains the Atmosphere/Kosmos pack with writing on the PRODINFO partition enabled and the NOGC patch disabled and some useful modules installed, the SX OS pack, the most useful homebrews, the cheats for Atmosphere and SX OS installed and the emulator pack that replaces the configuration files of these. </li>

</ul>
<h2>V2.10.38 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added module management in the preparation of an SD. As for homebrews or cheats, the modules can be managed via profiles that can be configured either during the preparation of the SD, or via the script settings menu and of course, the profiles are saved by the backup function. </li>
<li>Revision of a lot of elements of the ReiNX and Atmosphere packs, precisely to fit with the new module management. It is strongly recommended to reset the CFW files of the SD if you update the SD created with a previous version of the script. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li> Update of 4NXCI to version 4.01.</li>

</ul>
<h2>V2.10.35 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>

<li>The script for saving important elements now takes into account emulator profiles. </li>
<li>The "Backup, restore or reset script files or settings" menu of the main menu has been renamed "Backup/restore and script settings" to be more explicit about its content. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.34 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Modification of the organization of some folders because there were problems with Retro_Reloaded. </li>

<ul>
<li> Updating Goldtree to version 0.5.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.32 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<In the preparation of an SD, the text display is a little more airy and the copy of payloads for the homebrew Payload_Launcher now follows the choices made during the script, except for a few payloads that are copied by default with this homebrew. Another modification, the copy of the Memloader payload is now based on the file in the packs rather than on the old file used by the script that had been there for a while, I should have made this modification much earlier but it has been trapped so far.</li>
<li>Deletion of the "memloader.bin" file no longer needed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.31</h2>
<ul>
<li>Corrected a bug in the preparation of an SD, CFW payloads were not copied for use by Retro_Reloaded.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.30 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li> Retro_Reloaded payload update to version 0.46.</li>
<li> Updating the preparation of an SD to include the copy of Memloader in Retro_Reloaded if the pack is copied. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.29 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Payload suport from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RetroGamer74/RR_RetroReloaded/releases">Retro_reloaded</a> for the payload launch functionality as well as in the preparation of an SD, it will be copied to important places according to the choices made. This modification therefore makes a lot of changes in the packs that change to version 119.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.28 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li> Updated preparation of an SD to delete a folder from the SD that will no longer be used with 118.</li> packs
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.27 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li> Taking into account the homebrew Payload_Launcher in the profile management for optional homebrews, adding it to the copy list of all default homebrews and describing it in doc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.26 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<In preparing an SD, the copy of the ReiNX pack has been slightly modified to correctly use the configuration of the 115 packs, see the pack changelog for more info. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.25</h2>
<ul>
<Added the possibility to reboot on ReiNX directly via the Reboot_to_payload homebrew or via the console restart menu for the ReiNX CFW. The ReiNX payload is now copied to the SD thanks to the script for preparing an SD in the "ReiNX" directory of the SD and is named "reboot_payload.bin", allowing the desired restart. </li>
<li>Always in the preparation of an SD but for the Atmosphere package this time, added the possibility to configure write permissions on the PRODINFO partition. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.24</h2>
<ul>
<li> Updating Split_NSP to the latest "Master" version of the Github and updating the script using it to take into account the new parameters. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.23</h2>

<li> Update of the ReiNX launch payload to version 2.1.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.22 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update of the preparation of an SD to take into account the configuration files of the new versions of Pnes, Psnes and PFBA. The packs must therefore be in version 108.</li>
<li> Updating the documentation of the packs. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.21</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update of the payload launching ReiNX, so the CFW must be updated. </li>
<In the preparation of the SD, if Atmosphere is chosen to be copied, a warning message for the copy of ReiNX and firmwares 7.0.0 and above is displayed to prevent that Atmosphere will no longer be usable via its payload Fusee Primary for these firmwares. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.20</h2>
<ul>
<li>Integration of a profile management for copying cheats in the preparation of an SD as well as in the backup/restore features. Note that profiles are saved when the backup function for important files is performed. </li>
<li>Some other small corrections. </li>
<li> Update of known bugs in the documentation. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.19</h2>
<ul>
<li> Updating 4NXCI to version 4.0.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.18</h2>
<ul>
<li> SimpleUF2 payload update in version 0.99R4.</li>
<li>In the preparation of an SD, correction of texts appearing during cheat copy requests, the function was functional but the message was not the right one.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.17</h2>
<ul>
<li>In the preparation of an SD, EdiZon is automatically copied to the SD if the copy of cheats is chosen for the Atmosphere pack. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.16</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adding the copy of a cheat database in the preparation of an SD for the Atmosphere and SX OS packages. </li>
<li> Documentation update. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.15</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update Hekate to version 4.9.1, important to use the new configuration files of the Atmosphere packs if launched via Hekate. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.14</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to restore a part of a dump or a complete dump in a dump file, allowing for example to replace a partition in a dump already done. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.13</h2>
<ul>
<li> Updating NxNandManager to version 1.1.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.12 (don't overwrite an old version because there are many file/folder changes)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fusion of the Atmosphere and Kosmos pack into a single pack. For the moment, the old Hekate configurations have been kept and renamed to "name_of_configuration_file.ini.old", to restore them it will be enough to rename the file by deleting the".old" at the end.</li>
<li> Updating the documentation of the packs. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.11</h2>
<ul>
<li> Updating NXNandManager. </li>

<li> Update of NSC_Builder to version 0.81 Beta2.</li>
<li> Updating the documentation of the packs. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.08</h2>
<ul>
<li>Access to the reunification function of a split nand dump via the Nand Toolbox. </li>
<li>In preparing an SD, the SD data deletion function has been modified, it now allows you to either delete all data in the SD, or delete all data in the CFWs (including the CFW titles folder) or delete nothing and make the copy normally. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.07</h2>
<ul>
<li>Corrected a bug in the reunification of a nand dump, the 15-part Hekate dumps always caused an error indicating missing files and therefore reunification could not be done. Another bug has been fixed, the dump is correctly preserved at the end of the script. Finally, a check is made to know if a "rawnand.bin" file already exists in the copy location of the file to know if the file should be overwritten or not. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.06</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update NSC_Builder to version 0.80 beta, translated version. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.05</h2>
<ul>
<li>Correction of a bug introduced by washing 2.10.03 occurring at the end of the preparation of an SD.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.04</h2>
<ul>
<li>Corrected a bug preventing the script to attach files of a split nand from being reunited. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.03</h2>
<ul>
<li>Small bugs fixed in the preparation of an SD. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.02</h2>
<ul>
<li>Launching a payload via a selected file now works correctly. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.01</h2>
<ul>
<When preparing an SD, the summary of what will be copied will be displayed at the end of the configuration, allowing you to cancel or confirm the copying action. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.10.00 (don't overwrite an old version because there are many file/folder changes)</h2>
<ul>
<Now, it is possible to create profiles to install the homebrews you want on the SD when preparing it. As a result, the old versions of my script will no longer work with the new packages and some features such as preparing an update package on the SD to be installed with ChoiDuJourNX will no longer work. This new version of my script must therefore be used with a version of the packs at least equal to 94 and the old versions of my script will only work with version 93 or less of the packs. In fact, I recommend using the configuration backup/restore function to update without losing your settings or key files. </li>
<li>The backup function will now also save the installation profiles of the optional homebrews. </li>
<The script for preparing an update for ChoiDuJourNX now allows you to download and work on the 7.0.1 firmware. This script has also been revised to be adapted to the new version 94 of the packs. </li>
<li> Documentation update. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.00.18</h2>
<ul>
<li>The script for preparing an SD proposes to activate or not the "nogc" patch for the Kosmos pack, this is related to the new configuration of Hekate 4.8 for which configurations with the "nogc" patch are no longer useful because this patch is managed via a global configuration parameter. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.00.17</h2>
<ul>
<li>ReiNX payload replacement to be compatible with version 89 of the packs. </li>
<li> Hekate update to version 4.8.</li>
<li>Goldtree Downgrade in version 0.3 because many people seem to have problems with the 0.4.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.00.16</h2>
<ul>
<li> Update of the Atmosphere payload for version 0.8.4.</li>
<li>Update the ReiNX payload with the latest "master" version of the Github, compiled by myself. </li>
<li>Update NxNandManager with the latest "Master" version of the Github, compiled by myself. </li>
<li> Documentation update. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.00.15</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update NxNandManager, files are no longer compressed with UPX.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.00.14</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adding the nand management function to the occasional functions, thanks to @eliboa who worked hard on this with NxNandManager. </li>
<To mount the different parts of the Switch, the Memloader version used is the one used by the latest version of Tegra_RCM_Gui, this one allows you to skip the confirmation on the console to mount the desired storage. The old version of Memloader is still present because it is the one used when copying this payload to the SD when preparing it. </li>
<li> Documentation update. </li>
<Maybe other things I forgot. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.00.13 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li> Hekate update to version 4.6_svc.</li>
<li>Update of the script for preparing an SD that eliminates duplicate files in packs, see the pack changelog (version 86) for more information on this adaptation. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.00.12</h2>
<ul>
<li> Updating Goldtree to version 0.4.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.00.11 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>The script to prepare an SD with firmware and ChoiDuJour-NX now supports the download of firmware 7.0.0. Warning, the different CFWs are not yet compatible with this firmware. </li>
<li> Biskeydump update to version 8.</li>
<li> Update of 4NXCI to version 3.06.</li>
<li>Deletion of the package preparing a light Kosmos package for version 1.0.0, now the main package will work on all firmware because all permissions are enabled for all configurations in Hekate (except "stock" configuration). In fact, the specific function of my script for this firmware has also been removed. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.00.10</h2>
<ul>
<li>Corrected a bug in the download function of a firmware that caused the script to crash if it was then converted via ChoiDuJour and then tried to redo an action of this script behind.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.00.09</h2>
<ul>
<li>The key verification script now displays missing keys that can be verified. It also displays the number of keys in each of the output lists if they are greater than one. Finally, for developers, the key test function now returns all displayed lists in addition to the list of verified keys that can be used for future use, the function of creating a key file for ChoiDuJour has been modified to be adapted to this last change.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.00.08</h2>
<ul>
<li>Corrected a bug in NSC_Builder that prevented the update mode from being used correctly. </li>
<li>Modification of the NSC_builder launch script to remove things that had been used for debugging and therefore useless now. </li>
<li>Various optimizations and modifications of the Python script for managing the keys of a key file. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.00.07</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add a Python script to test the keys of the "prod.keys" file (also known as "keys.txt" or "keys.dat"...) to know if keys are unknown/unique or incorrect. This script also allows you to create a key file for ChoiDuJour containing only the keys needed for this process; the file will be based on a complete key file that must be provided by the user. Finally, the script also allows you to create the file to check the keys in the other features but be careful, no verification is done during this process and the previous file will be deleted so use this feature only if you know what you are doing. The script is located in the "tools\python3_scripts\Keys_management" folder and requires Python 3 to be executed via the file "keys_management.py"; executing the script without parameters will display its help. There are a lot of things to improve for this script (code optimization in particular) but for the moment it works like this, it's my first real Python script so be indulgent. </li>
<When an update package creation via ChoiDuJour is attempted, the used key file is now created on the fly via the key file provided to the script, this avoids errors related to unknown keys from Hactool during the process. This is made possible by the Python script described above. </li>
<li>Added a function to test keys that are not unique to the console and determine if some are fake. For example, it is possible to test a "prod.keys" key file created by the Lockpick homebrew. This is made possible by the Python script described above. This feature can be found in the occasional functions menu. </li>
<li>Update the Gitget Python script so that the path to "SVN.exe" is correctly detected no matter where the script is executed from. </li>
<li>Update the readme to include the GPL V3 license in the new Python script created. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.00.06</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added a check in the scripts for preparing an SD in case the update of the packs via the script failed. If the file "tools\packs_version.txt" is found, these scripts will not work because this file indicates that an update of the packs via the script failed while the absence of this file indicates that the update of the packs via the script was successful. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.00.05</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update of the pack check which will now take into account the version that was installed before if the update has crashed and the script has been restarted in the meantime. As a result, the version of the packs will only be updated if the installation is successful. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.00.04</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adding Gitget and a portable version of SVN that will then be used to update the script or at least parts of it. </li>
<li>Ability to update script packs directly via the update function, either automatically at the beginning of the script or manually via the menus. The update takes time because it reloads all the content of the packs every time but it's the best I've found so far. </li>
<li>Add a version for all the packs of the script to check if there is an update of the packs and add a specific changelog for the packs in the documentation. </li>
<li>Adding the MGBA emulator to the emulator pack. </li>
<li> Update of SX Install in version 1.3.</li>
<li> Update of the different scripts and configurations for EdiZon. </li>
<li> Documentation update. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.00.03 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update Atmosphere to the latest "Master" version of the Github for Kosmos and Atmosphere packs, compiled by myself. </li>
<li>Update EdiZon to the latest "Master" version of the Github, compiled by myself. </li>
<li>The homebrew "CFW-Setting" has been renamed "Kosmos-Toolbox" in the Kosmos packs. </li>
<li> Documentation update. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.00.02</h2>
<ul>
<li>Corrected a bug during the preparation of an SD that caused the Hekate configuration file to be incorrectly copied when installing the Kosmos pack and the Atmosphere pack at the same time (bug initiated in version 2.00.00).</li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.00.01</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bug fixes in the NSC_Builder launch script for the function to open the output directory of the files in it. Other important bugs in this script have also been fixed. </li>
<li>NSC_Builder now runs in a separate window from my script which definitely prevents it from having any influence on it. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V2.00.00.00</h2>
<ul>
<li> Updating Atmosphere to version 0.8.3 for Kosmos and Atmosphere packs. The homebrew "reboot_to_payload" has been added and the payload chosen for the reboot is Hekate for both packs, those who use the Atmosphere pack to restart it by launching the payload via Hekate, it will be automatically copied into the correct SD directory during the installation of the pack. </li>
<li> HBL update to version 2.1.0 for the Atmosphere, Kosmos and ReiNX packages. </li>
<li> Simple-UF2 payload update in version 97.</li>
<li> Documentation update. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.99.97</h2>
<ul>
<li> Updating EdiZon to version 2.0.1.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.99.96</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update Atmosphere to the latest master version of the Github for the Atmosphere and Kosmos packs, compiled by myself. </li>
<li> Updating EdiZon to version 2.0.</li>
<li>Adding python sources for SSNC and NSC_Builder, will not be used for the script but allows to see the source code of the elements compiled with Pyinstaller for those interested. The other projects using Python already had the included sources, only these two projects did not include them, it is now done. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.99.95 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deletion of a folder that is not currently used for the script. </li>
<li>Adding Kip Select to the Atmosphere pack. </li>
<li> Pplay update to version 1.5.</li>
<li> Updating NX-Shell to version 1.20.</li>
<li> Updating Goldleaf and Goldtree to version 0.3.</li>
<li>Update Atmosphere to the latest master version of the Github for the Atmosphere and Kosmos packs, compiled by myself. </li>
<li>Update EdiZon and SwitchIdent to the latest "master" version of the Github, compiled by myself. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.99.94</h2>
<ul>
<Adding the payload Pk1decryptor to retrieve some keys that may one day be useful and that also allows to decrypt the package 1 of the Switch. The folder necessary for this operation is now created on the SD when installing all the packs, it will be enough to put the right file to decrypt. Be careful, the keys or information obtained are unique for each console so they should not be shared. </li>
<li> Update Switch-Lan-Play client to version 0.1.0.</li>
<li>Update SwitchIdent to the latest "master" version of the Github, compiled by myself. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.99.93</h2>
<ul>
<li>The problem of missing empty directories on the Github has been solved and the SD preparation scripts have been updated to adapt to these changes. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.99.92 (do not overwrite an old version because some file/folder rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Corrected a bug that sometimes caused empty folders not to be copied during the preparation of an SD and this could cause problems for some actions. </li>

<h2>V1.99.85</h2>
<ul>
<li>Corrected a very big bug in the toolbox that caused problems when adding a program, the path to it was not well turned and in fact the launch of these programs did not work. If you have created a program list for your toolbox, please reset it because it does not work with older versions. </li>
<li>Small modification of the documentation. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.99.84</h2>
<ul>
<li>The serial database file has been renamed, so the old versions of the script for this feature will no longer work. </li>
<li> Updating the address to allow me to report inconsistencies on the database of serial numbers of consoles patched or not. </li>

In fact, the encoding of this script has changed to "chcp 1252" (encoding "windows-1252") so it is possible that the old server lists no longer work with this new version, so please recreate them. A major bug has normally been fixed in this function, now servers containing the "/" character should be able to be renamed correctly. </li>
<li>Added the possibility to enable or disable the automatic update check function. The parameter can also be reset if necessary via the backup/restore/reset menu, moreover the parameter is saved by the backup function. </li>
<li>Added toolbox to launch software with a graphical interface or scripts running without any particular parameters (all programs stand alone in bulk). The toolbox also allows you to configure a personal list of such programs. It will be backed up by the backup function (the entire folder will be backed up) and it can also be restored by default (the entire folder is restored by default) (the complete script reset also resets it). </li>
<li>The server list for Switch-Lan-Play can now be reset via the backup/restore/reset menu. </li>
<li>The different key files can now be deleted via the backup/restore/reset menu. </li>

<li>Added a message indicating that the database file for serial number verification cannot be downloaded and modified the SSNC "config.ini" file because there was a small error in it that prevented it from working without an internet connection. For the moment, the database download has been disabled and a modified database file is used because there are some errors in the SSNC database at the moment. </li>
<li>Update Ldn_mitm version 0.2.3 in the Kosmos package and add the module for ReiNX version 0.2.2.2 for ReiNX, the module will be activated with ReiNX Toolbox for this CFW. </li>
<li>Update ReiNX and JKSV to the latest "master" version, compiled by myself. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.89</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reintegration of ReiNX because since 2.0 some features differ from Atmosphere. The reintegrated version is the latest "master" version of the Github compiled by me, version 2.0 had a bug that prevented it from starting. I advise to clean the "ReiNX" folder on the SD completely before installing the pack, many things have changed with this version. </li>

<li> Documentation update. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.87</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update Atmosphere to the latest "Master" version of the Github, compiled by myself. The Kosmos package has also been updated with this latest version and some ReiNX files also use this latest version of compiled Atmosphere. </li>

<li>Update of JKSV via the latest "master" version of the Github, compiled by myself. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.86</h2>
<ul>
<li> Update of the ReiNX payload that I forgot to update in the previous version. </li>

<li>Updates of FTPD, JKSV and HBMenu in the latest version, compiled by myself. </li>
<li>Reset to default color once the NSC_Builder script ends. </li>
<li>Small update of the tutorial for ChoiDuJourNX in doc. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.85</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added a function to check if a console is patched or not (function found in the features to use occasionally in the script), thanks to AkdM from Logic-sunrise for its database and for its Python script which simplified my work enormously. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.84</h2>
<ul>
<li> Updating SX OS to version 2.5 Beta.</li>
<li>Update ReiNX to the latest "master" version of the Github, compiled by myself. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.83</h2>

<Added a new feature to download a specific firmware to copy it to the SD for updating via ChoiDuJourNX or creating an update package via ChoiDuJour. This script replaces the old functionality that was in the "other functions" and the old method has been moved to the "occasional functions". Attention, please read all the warnings and information given at the beginning of this new script. </li>
<li> Updating the script to create an update package via ChoiDuJour to adapt it also to the new script to prepare an update described above. </li>

<li> Switch-lan-plad update in twist 0.0.7.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.80</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update SX OS to version 2.4 beta. As there seem to be problems for this version, I will exceptionally put version 2.3 beta in a folder named "SX OS 2.3B" at the root of the script for those wishing to come back under this version, they will only have to copy the file "boot.dat" that will contain the folder at the root of the SD to switch back to 2.3 (not compatible with firmware 6.2.0 as a reminder while 2.4 is). </li>
<li> Update of the tutorial on Lockpick in the documentation. </li>
<li>Update NSC_Builder to version 0.77, translated and adapted as usual. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.79 (do not overwrite an old version because some folder/files rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update NSC_Builder to the latest "Master" version of the Github, translated and modified for my script. I remind you that even if the script has been modified, it can still be used completely independently and without the need to install Python 3.7 and the.</li> dependencies
<li>Corrected a bug in the script to attach the nand's dump files, the script did not correctly detect 15-part dumps. </li>
<li>Correction of the file "hekate_ipl.ini" for the Kosmos pack. </li>
<Added a warning about the switch going into standby when installing games via Tinfoil and network or USB. </li>
<li>Update Tinfoil to the latest version, compiled by myself. </li>
<li> Minor documentation updates. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.78</h2>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2>V1.77 (do not overwrite an old version because some folder/files rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update ReiNX to the latest version, compiled by myself. This version therefore supports the firmware 6.2.0.</li>
<li>Corrected the reunification script of a dump, the split dump via SX OS did not work. </li>
<li> Update of some Kosmos package files. </li>
<li>Deletion of Kezplez-NX which is now replaced by Lockpick, I compiled the latest version by the way. </li>
<li> Documentation update. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.76 (do not overwrite an old version because some folder/files rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added the feature to reunify files of a split dump done with SX OS in the dump reunification script. This script has not been tested at all because I don't have a split dump at hand to do it so feedback will be greatly appreciated on this feature, whether it is a dump done via Hekate or SX OS.</li>
<li> Updating Atmosphere to version 0.8.2. With this new version, all the Atmosphere files are located in the "atmosphere" folder of the SD so the "BCT.ini" and "fusee-secondary.bin" files at the root of the SD will be deleted by the script to prepare an SD.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.75</h2>
<ul>
<li>Creation of a script allowing to attach the files of the nand dumped in several parts via Hekate (the one of 15*2 GO or 30*1 GO) (useful for those using an SD in FAT32 or an SD smaller than the final size of the dump). This script performs some checks but it is better to immediately test the dump obtained with HacDiskMount, the launch of it will be proposed at the end of the script. This script can be found in the "Other functions" section of the main menu. </li>
<li>Update to the latest "master" version of NSC_Builder, translate and adapt it to my script. </li>
<li> Documentation update. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.74 (do not overwrite an old version because some folder/files rework)</h2>

<li> Update of Hactool to version 1.2.2.2.</li>
<li>Update SwitchIddent to the latest version, compiled by myself. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Update NSC_Builder to version 1.65, always modified to be also adapted to my script. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.70 (do not overwrite an old version because some folder/files rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update the NSC_Builder script to the latest "master" version of the Github and fix some errors I had made in it as well as in its launch procedure, I hope everything will work fine. I also made a small modification in the script because there is a bug with the input files ending with a "2" or "1" and which gave an error in the output directory, which is no longer the case.</li>
<li> Updating SX OS to version 2.3 beta.</li>
<li>Removal of WainDumper to replace it with SXDumper 1.0.2.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.69</h2>
<ul>
<li>Translation of the NSC_Builder script V0.6.1 (except the Python file which will probably never be translated) and adaptation of it to my script. It should be noted that the script can still be used independently of my script but without having to install Python or dependencies. For the moment the script has not been tested for all cases but it should work correctly. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.68 (do not overwrite an old version because some folder/files rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Change an item in the NSC_Builder configuration file (location of the key file) that caused it to crash. </li>
<li>Corrected a bug in the NSC_Builder launch script that caused the key file to be requested all the time. </li>
<li>Corrected a bug that occurred when the script was abruptly left, almost all scripts required this correction. </li>
<li> Update of 4NXCI to version 2.01.</li>
<li>Update Kosmos to version 11.0.1.</li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.67 (do not overwrite an old version because some folder/files rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Removal of the RajNX package because Atmosphere does the job as well. </li>
<li>Added a variable to know if the script was launched via the main menu. This variable is useful for scripts that can be independent such as NSC_Builder, will be used later. </li>
<li>Add NSC_builder, unmodified and untranslated version for the moment, only Python is not required to use it. </li>
<li>Added WAINDUMPER 2.0 homebrew to dumper game cartridges. For the moment I haven't removed GCDumpTool but this may be done in future versions if I think this homebrew is no longer useful. </li>
<li> Update of Hactool to version 1.2.1.</li>
<li> Atmosphere update in version 0.7.5.</li>
<li> Updating NX-Shell to version 1.05.</li>
<li>Update SDFilesSwitch to Kosmos V11.</li>
<li>Update SysFTPd and Atmosphere in the SDFilesSwitch package to the latest version, compiled by myself. </li>
<li>Update of the HBMenu to the latest version, compiled by myself. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.66 (do not overwrite an old version because some folder/files rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Implementation of the "nogc" patch for Atmosphere (useful in firmware 4.0.0 and higher if you were previously in firmware lower than 4.0.0 and you want to downgrade one day without losing the use of the cartridge port for firmware lower than 4.0.0). If you no longer wish to use this patch, simply reinstall the Atmosphere package and answer no when the question of the application of the "nogc" patch for Atmosphere will be asked, just as it has been the case for some time with the ReiNX package. It should be noted that the "nogc" patch for Atmosphere and ReiNX is not the same and that they are therefore independent of each other. </li>
<li>Deletion of the folder "atmosphere/kip_patches" and "atmosphere\kips" in the SDFilesSwitch package because they are useless for this package. If you do not use the Atmosphere package, these folders can be deleted manually from the SD because the script will not do so. </li>
<li> Updating the name of the folder containing the "ES" patches. The script will manage this change itself on the SD, the old folders will be deleted (the "atmosphere/exefs_patches" folder is reset each time the SDFilesSwitch, RajNX or Atmosphere package is updated). </li>
<li> Updating 4NXCI to version 2.0.</li>
<li>Update SwitchIdent and Zerotwoxci to the latest versions, compiled by myself. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.65 (do not overwrite an old version because some folder/files rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li> Updating the Homebrew Loader in the different packs. </li>
<li>Adding signature patches for firmware version 6.1.0 in the Atmosphere, RajNX and SDFilesSwitch packages.</li>
<li> Updating SX OS to version 2.2.1 Beta.</li>
<li>The signature patches have now the no's of the SDFilesSwitch folders so delete the "SUCCulent fake tickets" folders from the SD (in the "atmosphere/exefs_patches" folder) because the script will not do it. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.64 (do not overwrite an old version because some folder/files rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adding the SlideNX module to the SDFileSwitch package and adding an appropriate configuration file for Hekate.</li>
<li> Checkpoint update to version 3.5.0.</li>
<li> HBMenu update to version 3.0.</li>
<li>Update of Atmosphere (Atmosphere pack and SDFilesSwitch pack), EdiZon, Tinfoil and the python script for installing NSP via USB of the latter in the latest versions, compiled by myself. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.63 (do not overwrite an old version because some folder/files rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade of the SDFilesSwitch package to version 10.1, the configurations for Hekate are still a little different from the official version as well as the location of some.</li> files
<li> Updating 4NXCI to version 1.36. The XCI to NSP conversion script has been updated to suport the parameter allowing you to pass the creation and integration of the ticket and certificate. </li>
<li>Recompilation of GCDumpTool and Kezplez-NX with version 1.5.0 of LibNX, probably allowing to fix some bugs. </li>
<li>Updates of HBMenu, EdiZon, Tinfoil, Atmosphere (SDFilesSwitch and Atmosphere pack), Creport in all packs and SwitchIdent to the latest version, compiled by myself. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.62</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add a French server for netplay in the list of servers, thanks to @alantya.</li>

</ul>
<h2>V1.61</h2>
<ul>
<li> Atmosphere update in version 0.7.1 for the Atmosphere and SDFilesSwitch pack. </li>
<li> Switch-lan-play update to version 0.0.5.</li>
<li> HBLoader update to version 2.0.</li>

</ul>
<h2>V1.60 (do not overwrite an old version because some folder/files rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Corrected a major bug in the payload launch function that prevented the payload from launching. </li>
<li> Taking into account the file from the list of netplay servers in the backup/restoration function of important files in the script. </li>
<li>Improvement of the netplay script, especially in terms of error control and server list management. </li>
<li> Update of the Atmosphere pack in version 0.7.0.</li>
<li>Update of the SDFilesSwitch package to use the files of the 0.7.0 version of Atmosphere that I compiled, only for the part of the launch of Atmosphere via Hekate, the other configs have not been affected and therefore use the old versions.</li>
<li> Creport update in all packages (except SX OS). </li>
<li> Updating SX OS to version 2.2 Beta.</li>
<li> Updates of HBMenu and Tinfoil in the latest version, compiled by myself. </li>
</ul>

<li>Some minor corrections on different scripts. </li>
<li>Added the ability to cut XCIs with XCI Cutter. </li>

A list of servers can be managed but for the moment, you have to use characters that can't cause too much trouble to the script, the error control is really rudimentary so don't use the characters &,", \, ;, |, (,) and maybe others that I would have forgotten. </li>
<li> Updates of HBMenu, ReiNXToolkit and Tinfoil in the latest versions, compiled by myself. </li>
<li> Documentation update. </li>
</ul>

<li>Removal of SDFilesUpdater from the ReiNX pack. </li>
<li>Update the SDFilesSwitch package with the files from version 9.0.4. Of course, this version of SDFilesSwitch does not include ReiNX because there is a specific pack for this and the Hekate configuration files are not quite the same as for the official version (including the "nogc" patch as an alternative to each configuration for example)</li>
<li> Update of the Atmosphere pack, EdiZon and Tinfoil in the latest version, compiled by myself. </li>

<h2>V1.10 (do not overwrite an old version because some folder/files rework)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Modification of the Hekate configuration file to include launch configurations again with the "nogc" patch ("prevent GC access") disabling the cartridge port but allowing not to update the firmware of the cartridge port for firmwares 4.0 and higher. This feature is useful if you have updated firmware 3.0.2 or lower with ChoiDuJour and you want to return to these firmwares one day while using the cartridge port.

<li>Update of the different files based on TumGER SDFilesSwitch 6.1 version in the preparation of an SD, the old "Hekate.ini" file that I had customized has been replaced (no more suport for the "nogc" patch via Hekate for now). To access the homebrew loader under Hekate and ReiNX, you must now stay pressed "R" and click on the album, as for SXOS.</li>

To use this version you have to run Hekate then boot on the "Atmosphere" input (have a complete dump of the nand in case you use this function), the other CFW inputs always use the SDFilesSwitch version of TumGER. </li>
<li> Documentation update, especially for the content of packs copied during the preparation of an SD. </li>
</ul>
<h2>V1.06</h2>
<ul>
<li>Suppression of the possibility to format an SD in FAT32 with 64 KB clusters because XCI Cutter only supports SDs using 32 KB clusters </li>
<li>Adding HacDiskMount and possibility to launch it at the end of the script allowing to mount a system partition (Boot0, Boot1 or EMMC).</li>
<li>Modification of the Hekate configuration file, all configurations to launch CFWs (except Atmosphere) now include the automatic patch to disable NSP file signature verification (see info for the new Hekate function below). New configurations have also been added, including the patch to not update the cartridge port firmware for firmware 4.0 and higher (noted "+ Prevent GC Access"). These functions are implemented but not tested, feedback is welcome). </li>
