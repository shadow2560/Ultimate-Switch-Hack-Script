<h1>Using ChoiDuJourNX</h1>
&nbsp;
<p>
In this tutorial we will see how to use the homebrew ChoiDuJourNX to update the Switch, whether it is the SX OS emunand or the sysnand (the console itself). In this tutorial, I will assume that you know how to launch a CFW and a homebrew, refer to this FAQ if you don't know how to do it. I will also assume that you have prepared your SD using my script to set up the update data as well as ChoiDuJourNX on the SD 
<br/><br/>
Warning: Do not update the sysnand of a patched console via this method and do not use ChoiDuJour-NX on a console equipped with an SX Core or SX Lite modchip. Also note that this homebrew is no longer compatible with the latest versions of Atmosphere, use Daybreak instead which works more or less the same way.
<br/><br/>
Before starting, note that installing firmware via ChoiDuJourNX will automatically activate auto-RCM if an option is not unchecked during the installation procedure (read the tutorial to the end for things like whether to disable auto-RCM), that the update concerns the emunand or the sysnand it will not change that. Also note that the auto-RCM can, if you wish, be disabled just after the manipulations, see the end of this little tutorial to learn more. Note that in case of an update of the emunand only, the auto-RCM can be safely disabled if the sysnand has not been updated. 
<br/><br/>
First, it is better to make sure that the console has at least 50% of battery to make sure that the console does not turn off in the middle of the process. 
<br/><br/>
We launch the homebrew ChoiDuJourNX, we click on the folder in which the firmware is located (via my script it will be the mention "fw_" followed by the firmware number). We find ourselves in a folder containing a multitude of elements named in hexadecimal and with the extension".nca", it is the right place so we click on "choose" at the bottom right of the screen. 
<br/><br/>
The software will offer either the classic firmware version or the EXFAT version. I recommend to install the EXFAT version, even if you don't use this format for your SD card it can still be used. Once chosen, a preparation begins. 
<br/><br/>
Once the first loading is completed, click on "select firmware" and then another loading phase starts.
<br/><br/>
Once the second step is completed, you can uncheck the "auto-RCM" box in the left menu if you do not want to activate the auto-RCM then you can click on "Start installation" and once it is finished, you click on "Reboot". 
<br/><br/>
If you wish, the auto-RCM that was enabled during this update (unless the option has been unchecked in which case it will not be enabled) can be disabled (see the FAQ about Efuses and auto-RCMRCM to understand the consequences of such choices) either via Hekate via the "tools" menu or via SX Loader via the start menu (I remind you that to access it you must keep the "volume +" button on the console until the options appear on the menu) in the "Options" menu then "AutoRCM" then "Disable" and finally "Continue".
