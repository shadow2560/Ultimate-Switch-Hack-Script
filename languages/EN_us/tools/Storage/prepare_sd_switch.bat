echo This script will prepare a SD card with files that used by the hack ^(CFWs, homebrews, modules...^).
echo During the script, the admin's rights could be asked.
echo.
echo Be careful: If you decide to format the SD, all datas on it will be lost so save the importants datas before doing that.
echo Be careful: Choose the good letter for your SD because no verification could be done to verify that point.
echo.
echo You could find a folder named "sd_user" at this script root.
echo The content of this folder will be copied to the root of your SD and will always be the last copy on the SD so you can put your personal configuration files like your SX OS license, specific settings for Hekate... whatever you want.
echo For example, to use a personal file for Hekate, you will have to create a "bootloader" folder and put your "hekate_ipl.ini" file in it.
